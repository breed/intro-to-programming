# Numbers

*There are only 10 kinds of people in the world: those who understand binary and
those who don't.*

If that joke doesn't make sense yet, it will by the end of this chapter.

At its heart, a CPU is a super-fast glorified calculator. Everything it does —
drawing pixels on your screen, playing your favorite Depeche Mode track, sending
a message — ultimately boils down to operations on numbers. When we think about
the number five, we might write `5`, or `V`, or `|||||`, but they all represent
the same thing. You already saw in Chapter 9 that the character `'5'` is actually
stored as the ASCII code `53`. There are many ways to represent a number, and in
this chapter you will learn why that matters and how C++ lets you work with them.

## 1. Bases

Let's extend that joke. *There are only 10 kinds of people in the world: those
who understand binary, those who don't, and those who weren't expecting this joke
to be in base 3. And those who weren't expecting base 4. And those who...*

You get the idea. The punchline changes depending on which **base** (or
**radix**) you are using.

### Decimal (Base 10)

You have been using decimal your whole life. It uses ten digits: `0` through `9`.
Each position represents a power of 10:

```
  4   7   2
  |   |   |
  |   |   +-- 2 × 10^0 =   2
  |   +------ 7 × 10^1 =  70
  +---------- 4 × 10^2 = 400
                          ---
                          472
```

A number is divisible by 10 when its last digit is `0`. You can tell if a number
is divisible by 2 by checking whether its last digit is even. Divisibility by 8
is trickier — you have to check the last three digits. These rules come directly
from how place values work.

### Binary (Base 2)

It is often said that computers think in 1s and 0s. That is not entirely
accurate, but at the lowest level, data is stored in **bits** — each one either
`0` or `1`. Binary is base 2, so each position represents a power of 2:

```
  1   0   1   0   1   0
  |   |   |   |   |   |
  |   |   |   |   |   +-- 0 × 2^0 =  0
  |   |   |   |   +------ 1 × 2^1 =  2
  |   |   |   +---------- 0 × 2^2 =  0
  |   |   +-------------- 1 × 2^3 =  8
  |   +------------------ 0 × 2^4 =  0
  +---------------------- 1 × 2^5 = 32
                                    --
                                    42
```

Counting in binary looks like this:

```
Decimal:  0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
Binary:   0   1  10  11 100 101 110 111 1000
```

In binary, you can tell if a number is divisible by 2 by checking the last bit —
if it is `0`, the number is even. Divisible by 8? Check the last three bits. But
divisibility by 10 is no longer obvious at a glance.

::: {.tip}
**Tip:** Notice the symmetry. In decimal, divisibility by the base (10) is
trivial to check. In binary, divisibility by the base (2) is trivial. Each
system makes certain things easy and others hard.
:::

### Hexadecimal (Base 16)

Binary numbers get long quickly. The number `255` is `11111111` in binary — eight
digits for what decimal handles in three. **Hexadecimal** (hex) uses sixteen
digits: `0`–`9` and `A`–`F` (where `A` = 10, `B` = 11, ... `F` = 15). Each hex
digit represents exactly four bits:

```
Binary:  1010 1100
Hex:        A    C  ->  0xAC = 172
```

This makes hex a compact way to write binary values. Two hex digits represent one
byte (8 bits), and eight hex digits represent a 32-bit integer. You will see hex
used frequently for colors, memory addresses, and bit masks.

### Octal (Base 8)

**Octal** uses eight digits: `0`–`7`. Each octal digit represents exactly three
bits:

```
Binary:  101 010
Octal:     5   2  ->  052 = 42
```

Octal is less common than hex in modern code, but you will encounter it when
working with Unix file permissions (like `0755`).

### Try It: Counting in Binary

This program counts from 0 to 15 and prints each number in decimal, binary,
hex, and octal so you can see the patterns side by side:

```cpp
#include <print>

int main() {
    std::println("{:>4} {:>8} {:>4} {:>4}", "Dec", "Binary", "Hex", "Oct");
    std::println("{:->4} {:->8} {:->4} {:->4}", "", "", "", "");
    for (int i = 0; i <= 15; ++i) {
        std::println("{:4d} {:08b} {:4x} {:4o}", i, i, i, i);
    }
}
```

## 2. Literals in Other Bases

C++ lets you write integer literals in binary, hexadecimal, and octal using
prefixes. You first used integer literals in Chapter 2 when you initialized
variables like `int x = 42;` — that `42` is a decimal literal.

```cpp
int dec = 42;         // decimal (no prefix)
int bin = 0b101010;   // binary  (0b prefix)
int hex = 0x2A;       // hex     (0x prefix)
int oct = 052;        // octal   (0  prefix)
```

All four variables hold exactly the same value: `42`. The prefix only affects how
you write the number in your source code, not how it is stored.

::: {.tip}
**Tip:** Be careful with leading zeros. `052` is **not** decimal `52` — it is
octal `52`, which equals decimal `42`. This is a common source of confusion. If
you want decimal 52, write `52` without a leading zero.
:::

### Digit Separators

Large numbers can be hard to read. C++14 introduced the single-quote `'` as a
digit separator, which you can place anywhere between digits for readability:

```cpp
int billion    = 1'000'000'000;    // easier to read than 1000000000
int bits       = 0b1010'1100;      // group binary by nibbles (4 bits)
int color      = 0xFF'80'00;       // group hex by byte
```

The separator has no effect on the value — the compiler ignores it completely.

### Try It: Same Value, Different Spellings

This program shows that no matter how you write a literal, the compiler stores
the same number:

```cpp
#include <print>

int main() {
    int dec = 1984;
    int bin = 0b11111000000;
    int hex = 0x7C0;
    int oct = 03700;

    std::println("The year George Orwell warned us about:");
    std::println("  Decimal:  {}", dec);
    std::println("  Binary:   {}", bin);
    std::println("  Hex:      {}", hex);
    std::println("  Octal:    {}", oct);
    std::println("  All equal? {}", dec == bin && bin == hex && hex == oct);
}
```

## 3. Printing in Other Bases

C++23 gives you `std::format` and `std::println` with format specifiers that
make it easy to print numbers in different bases:

```cpp
int val = 42;
std::println("Decimal:     {}", val);      // 42
std::println("Binary:      {:b}", val);    // 101010
std::println("Hex:         {:x}", val);    // 2a
std::println("Hex (upper): {:X}", val);    // 2A
std::println("Octal:       {:o}", val);    // 52
```

You can also add a `#` flag to include the base prefix in the output:

```cpp
std::println("Binary:  {:#b}", val);   // 0b101010
std::println("Hex:     {:#x}", val);   // 0x2a
std::println("Octal:   {:#o}", val);   // 052
```

::: {.tip}
**Tip:** The format specifiers `{:b}`, `{:x}`, and `{:o}` display the value in a
different base, but they do not change the value itself. The variable still holds
the same number — you are just looking at it from a different angle.
:::

### Try It: Number Viewer

This program asks for a number and displays it in every base:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <print>

int main() {
    std::print("Enter a number: ");
    int val{};
    std::cin >> val;

    std::println("Decimal:  {}", val);
    std::println("Binary:   {:#b}", val);
    std::println("Hex:      {:#x}", val);
    std::println("Octal:    {:#o}", val);
}
```

## 4. Strings and Numbers

Programs frequently need to convert between strings and numbers — reading user
input, parsing files, or displaying results. C++ provides several functions for
this, each with different strengths.

### Strings to Integers

The `std::stoi` function (string-to-integer) converts a string to an `int`. You
first used `std::stoi` to convert strings to numbers in Chapter 9.

```cpp
int a = std::stoi("42");        // 42
int b = std::stoi("  -7");      // -7 (leading whitespace is skipped)
int c = std::stoi("1984abc");   // 1984 (stops at first non-digit)
```

For larger values, use `std::stol` for `long` or `std::stoll` for `long long`:

```cpp
long big = std::stol("3000000000");           // too large for int on most systems
long long huge = std::stoll("9000000000000");  // needs long long
```

::: {.tip}
**Tip:** `std::stoi` and its siblings throw `std::invalid_argument` if no
conversion can be performed and `std::out_of_range` if the value won't fit.
Always be prepared to handle these when converting user input.
:::

### The `pos` Parameter

The full signature of `std::stoi` is:

```cpp
int stoi(const std::string& str, std::size_t* pos = nullptr, int base = 10);
```

The second parameter, `pos`, receives the index of the first character that was
**not** part of the number. This is useful when a string contains a number
followed by other data:

```cpp
std::size_t pos;
int val = std::stoi("42px", &pos);
// val == 42, pos == 2 (index of 'p')
```

You can use `pos` to parse multiple numbers from a single string or to check
whether the entire string was consumed:

```cpp
std::string input = "100 200 300";
std::size_t pos = 0;
int first = std::stoi(input, &pos);            // first == 100, pos == 3
int second = std::stoi(input.substr(pos), &pos); // second == 200
```

If you don't need `pos`, pass `nullptr` (or just omit it):

```cpp
int x = std::stoi("42", nullptr);   // same as std::stoi("42")
```

### Strings to Floating Point

The functions `std::stof`, `std::stod`, and `std::stold` convert strings to
`float`, `double`, and `long double` respectively:

```cpp
float  f = std::stof("3.14");       // 3.14f
double d = std::stod("2.71828");    // 2.71828
double e = std::stod("1.5e3");      // 1500.0 (scientific notation)
```

These follow the same pattern as the integer functions — they skip leading
whitespace, stop at the first character that doesn't fit the number format, and
throw the same exceptions for bad input.

### Numbers to Strings

The `std::to_string` function converts numeric types back to strings:

```cpp
std::string s1 = std::to_string(42);       // "42"
std::string s2 = std::to_string(-7);       // "-7"
std::string s3 = std::to_string(3.14);     // "3.140000"
```

For more control over formatting, use `std::format` (introduced in Chapter 10):

```cpp
std::string s = std::format("{:.2f}", 3.14);   // "3.14"
std::string h = std::format("{:#x}", 255);     // "0xff"
```

### Converting Bases with `std::stoi`

The third parameter of `std::stoi` specifies the base to use when parsing. You
can use any base from 2 to 36:

```cpp
int a = std::stoi("101010", nullptr, 2);   // binary  -> 42
int b = std::stoi("2A", nullptr, 16);      // hex     -> 42
int c = std::stoi("52", nullptr, 8);       // octal   -> 42
```

The same base parameter works with `std::stol` and `std::stoll`:

```cpp
long d = std::stol("7C1", nullptr, 16);    // hex -> 1985
```

::: {.tip}
**Tip:** Pass base `0` and `std::stoi` will auto-detect the base from the
prefix — `0x` for hex, `0b` for binary, and a leading `0` for octal:

```
std::stoi("0x2A", nullptr, 0);      // hex -> 42
std::stoi("0b101010", nullptr, 0);  // binary -> 42
std::stoi("052", nullptr, 0);       // octal -> 42
```

This is convenient, but beware: with base 0, the string `"010"` is parsed as
**octal 8**, not decimal 10. If your data might have leading zeros that should
be treated as decimal, specify base 10 explicitly.
:::

### Manual Conversion

To convert a number from another base to decimal by hand, multiply each digit by
its place value and add the results:

```
0x2A = 2 × 16 + 10 × 1 = 42
052  = 5 × 8  +  2 × 1  = 42
```

To convert from decimal to another base, repeatedly divide by the base and
collect the remainders:

```
42 / 2 = 21 remainder 0
21 / 2 = 10 remainder 1
10 / 2 =  5 remainder 0
 5 / 2 =  2 remainder 1
 2 / 2 =  1 remainder 0
 1 / 2 =  0 remainder 1
Read remainders bottom-to-top: 101010
```

### Try It: Strings and Numbers

This program demonstrates conversions in both directions:

```cpp
#include <print>
#include <string>

int main() {
    // string to integer
    int year = std::stoi("1985");   // "Take On Me" was released in 1985
    std::println("Year: {}", year);

    // string to double
    double bpm = std::stod("150.2");
    std::println("BPM: {}", bpm);

    // number to string
    std::string msg = "Side " + std::to_string(1) + " of the cassette";
    std::println("{}", msg);

    // using the pos parameter
    std::size_t pos;
    int tempo = std::stoi("120bpm", &pos);
    std::println("Tempo: {} (unit starts at index {})", tempo, pos);

    // base conversions
    std::println("\n1985 in different bases:");
    std::println("  Hex \"7C1\"            = {}", std::stoi("7C1", nullptr, 16));
    std::println("  Binary \"11111000001\" = {}", std::stoi("11111000001", nullptr, 2));
    std::println("  Octal \"3701\"         = {}", std::stoi("3701", nullptr, 8));

    // base 0 auto-detection
    std::println("\nBase 0 auto-detection:");
    std::println("  \"0x7C1\"  = {}", std::stoi("0x7C1", nullptr, 0));
    std::println("  \"010\"    = {} (octal, not 10!)", std::stoi("010", nullptr, 0));
    std::println("  \"10\"     = {}", std::stoi("10", nullptr, 0));
}
```

## 5. Two's Complement

So far we have only talked about positive numbers. But how does the computer
represent negative numbers? You can't just put a minus sign in front of a binary
number — there are only 1s and 0s.

### One's Complement (and Why We Don't Use It)

An early idea was **one's complement**: flip every bit to get the negative. In an
8-bit system:

```
 42 = 0010 1010
-42 = 1101 0101  (every bit flipped)
```

This mostly works, but it has a fatal flaw: there are two representations of
zero.

```
+0 = 0000 0000
-0 = 1111 1111
```

Having two zeros complicates hardware and arithmetic. Is `-0 == +0`? It should
be, but the bit patterns differ. Engineers needed a better solution.

### Two's Complement

**Two's complement** fixes this by adding one extra step: flip all the bits
*and* add 1.

```
 42 = 0010 1010
      1101 0101  (flip bits)
    + 0000 0001  (add 1)
      ---------
-42 = 1101 0110
```

Now there is only one zero:

```
 0 = 0000 0000
     1111 1111  (flip bits)
   + 0000 0001  (add 1)
     ---------
     0000 0000  (overflow discarded — still 0!)
```

In two's complement, the highest bit (the **sign bit**) tells you whether the
number is negative. For an 8-bit signed integer:

- `0xxx xxxx` — positive (0 to 127)
- `1xxx xxxx` — negative (-128 to -1)

This gives 8-bit signed integers a range of **-128 to 127**. Notice that there is
one more negative value than positive — that's because zero takes one of the
"positive" slots.

::: {.tip}
**Tip:** Nearly every modern computer uses two's complement for signed integers.
When you declare `int x = -42;`, the bit pattern stored in memory is the two's
complement representation.
:::

### Why Two's Complement Is Brilliant

The beauty of two's complement is that addition and subtraction **just work**
with the same hardware used for unsigned numbers. The CPU does not need separate
circuitry for signed math — it uses the same adder for both.

### Try It: Seeing Two's Complement

This program shows the bit patterns of positive and negative numbers so you can
see two's complement in action:

```cpp
#include <cstdint>
#include <print>

int main() {
    int8_t values[] = {42, -42, 0, -1, 127, -128};
    for (int8_t i : values) {
        // cast to unsigned to see the raw bit pattern
        uint8_t bits = static_cast<uint8_t>(i);
        std::println("{:4d} = {:08b}", i, bits);
    }
}
```

Output:

```
  42 = 00101010
 -42 = 11010110
   0 = 00000000
  -1 = 11111111
 127 = 01111111
-128 = 10000000
```

## 6. Integer Sizes and Ranges

You saw that an 8-bit signed integer can hold values from -128 to 127. But
`int` is not 8 bits — so how big is it, and what range can it hold?

### Bytes

A group of 8 bits is called a **byte**, and it is the basic unit of measurement
for computer memory. When you buy a computer with 16 GB of RAM, you are buying
roughly 16 billion bytes of memory. More precisely, 1 GB (gigabyte) is 2^30^
bytes, which equals 1,073,741,824 — just over a billion. So 16 GB is
17,179,869,184 bytes. Close enough to 16 billion for casual conversation, but
the difference matters when you are counting precisely.

You will also encounter kilobytes (KB, 2^10^ = 1,024 bytes), megabytes (MB,
2^20^ = 1,048,576 bytes), and terabytes (TB, 2^40^). Notice a pattern: each
unit is a power of 2, not a power of 10, because binary makes powers of two the
natural grouping.

::: {.tip}
**Tip:** The `sizeof` operator in C++ returns sizes in bytes, not bits. Since
1 byte = 8 bits, a 4-byte `int` has 32 bits. You will see `sizeof` used
frequently when working with memory and data structures.
:::

### How Many Bits?

C++ has several integer types, each with a minimum guaranteed size. On most
modern systems, the sizes are:

| Type | Typical Size | Bits |
|:---|:---:|:---:|
| `char` | 1 byte | 8 |
| `short` | 2 bytes | 16 |
| `int` | 4 bytes | 32 |
| `long` | 4 or 8 bytes | 32 or 64 |
| `long long` | 8 bytes | 64 |

You can check the size of any type with the `sizeof` operator:

```cpp
std::println("char:      {} bytes", sizeof(char));       // 1
std::println("short:     {} bytes", sizeof(short));      // 2
std::println("int:       {} bytes", sizeof(int));        // 4
std::println("long long: {} bytes", sizeof(long long));  // 8
```

### The Range Formula

With `n` bits, you can represent 2^n^ distinct values. How those values are
divided depends on whether the type is signed or unsigned:

- **Unsigned** (no negatives): 0 to 2^n^ - 1
- **Signed** (two's complement): -2^(n-1)^ to 2^(n-1)^ - 1

For example, with 8 bits:

- Unsigned: 0 to 255 (2^8^ - 1)
- Signed: -128 to 127 (-2^7^ to 2^7^ - 1)

Here are the ranges for the common types:

| Type | Range |
|:---|:---|
| `unsigned char` | 0 to 255 |
| `signed char` | -128 to 127 |
| `unsigned short` | 0 to 65,535 |
| `short` | -32,768 to 32,767 |
| `unsigned int` | 0 to 4,294,967,295 (about 4.3 billion) |
| `int` | -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 (about +/- 2.1 billion) |
| `unsigned long long` | 0 to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 |
| `long long` | -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 |

::: {.tip}
**Tip:** If you are ever unsure about a type's range, use
`std::numeric_limits` from `<limits>`:

```
std::println("int max: {}", std::numeric_limits<int>::max());
std::println("int min: {}", std::numeric_limits<int>::min());
```
:::

### Signed vs. Unsigned

Every integer type has a signed and unsigned variant. You first saw `unsigned`
in Chapter 4 with `size_t`, the type returned by `.size()` on containers.

```cpp
unsigned int positive_only = 42;
int can_be_negative = -42;
```

An unsigned type gives up negative values in exchange for a larger positive
range. A 32-bit `unsigned int` can hold values up to about 4.3 billion, while
a signed `int` tops out around 2.1 billion.

::: {.tip}
**Tip:** Mixing signed and unsigned types in comparisons can cause surprising
bugs. The expression `-1 < 0u` is `false` because `-1` is implicitly
converted to a very large unsigned value. When possible, stick to
signed types for general arithmetic and use unsigned only when you have a
specific reason (like bit manipulation or interfacing with APIs that require
it).
:::

### What Happens When You Overflow?

If you try to store a value that does not fit, the behavior depends on whether
the type is signed or unsigned:

- **Unsigned overflow** wraps around. Adding 1 to the maximum value gives 0:

```cpp
unsigned char x = 255;
x = x + 1;  // x is now 0 (wraps around)
```

- **Signed overflow** is undefined behavior. The compiler can do anything:

```cpp
int y = 2'147'483'647;  // INT_MAX
y = y + 1;               // undefined behavior!
```

::: {.tip}
**Tip:** "Undefined behavior" is not just a theoretical concern. Compilers
actively exploit it for optimization. A signed overflow might silently wrap, or
it might cause your program to behave in completely unexpected ways. Never rely
on signed overflow.
:::

### Try It: Exploring Sizes and Limits

This program prints the size and range of each integer type:

```cpp
#include <limits>
#include <print>

int main() {
    std::println("{:<12} {:>5} {:>22} {:>22}",
                 "Type", "Bytes", "Min", "Max");

    std::println("{:<12} {:>5} {:>22} {:>22}", "char",
        sizeof(char),
        std::numeric_limits<signed char>::min(),
        std::numeric_limits<signed char>::max());

    std::println("{:<12} {:>5} {:>22} {:>22}", "short",
        sizeof(short),
        std::numeric_limits<short>::min(),
        std::numeric_limits<short>::max());

    std::println("{:<12} {:>5} {:>22} {:>22}", "int",
        sizeof(int),
        std::numeric_limits<int>::min(),
        std::numeric_limits<int>::max());

    std::println("{:<12} {:>5} {:>22} {:>22}", "long long",
        sizeof(long long),
        std::numeric_limits<long long>::min(),
        std::numeric_limits<long long>::max());

## 7. Binary Addition and Subtraction

### Binary Addition

Binary addition works just like decimal addition, but you carry at 2 instead of
10:

```
  0 + 0 = 0
  0 + 1 = 1
  1 + 0 = 1
  1 + 1 = 10  (0, carry 1)
```

Let's add `42 + 15` in 8-bit binary:

```
    0010 1010   (42)
  + 0000 1111   (15)
  -----------
    0011 1001   (57)
```

### Subtraction with Two's Complement

To subtract, you negate the second number (using two's complement) and add.
Let's compute `42 - 15`:

Step 1 — find `-15` using two's complement:

```
  15 = 0000 1111
       1111 0000   (flip bits)
     + 0000 0001   (add 1)
       ---------
 -15 = 1111 0001
```

Step 2 — add `42 + (-15)`:

```
    0010 1010   (42)
  + 1111 0001   (-15)
  -----------
  1 0001 1011
  ^
  overflow bit (discarded in 8 bits)
```

The result is `0001 1011` = 27. Correcto! The overflow bit is discarded because
we are working with 8-bit values, and the addition produces the right answer
automatically.

Let's also try a negative result: `15 - 42`:

Step 1 — find `-42`:

```
  42 = 0010 1010
       1101 0101   (flip bits)
     + 0000 0001   (add 1)
       ---------
 -42 = 1101 0110
```

Step 2 — add `15 + (-42)`:

```
    0000 1111   (15)
  + 1101 0110   (-42)
  -----------
    1110 0101   (-27)
```

The sign bit is `1`, so the result is negative. To verify, convert back: flip the
bits (`0001 1010`), add 1 (`0001 1011` = 27), so the answer is `-27`. Perfecto.

::: {.tip}
**Tip:** Overflow can happen when the result is too large (or too small) for the
number of bits. Adding two large positive numbers can wrap around to a negative
value. In C++, signed integer overflow is **undefined behavior** — the compiler
is free to do anything. Be careful with arithmetic near the limits of a type.
:::

### Try It: Unsigned Wraparound

This program demonstrates unsigned addition wrapping around, the same way the
CPU adds binary numbers:

```cpp
#include <cstdint>
#include <print>

int main() {
    uint8_t a = 200;
    uint8_t b = 100;
    uint8_t result = a + b;  // 300 doesn't fit in 8 bits

    std::println("{} + {} = {} (wrapped)", a, b, result);
    // 200 + 100 = 44 (wrapped), because 300 - 256 = 44

    uint8_t x = 42;
    uint8_t y = 15;
    std::println("{} + {} = {}", x, y, static_cast<int>(x + y));
    std::println("{} - {} = {}", x, y, static_cast<int>(x - y));
}
```

## 8. Shift Operators

The shift operators `<<` and `>>` move bits left or right by a specified number
of positions. You first saw `<<` and `>>` used for stream I/O — here we are
talking about their original purpose as bitwise operators. For a deeper look at
all the bitwise operators, see the Operators chapter.

### Left Shift: `<<`

Left shift moves every bit to the left and fills the empty positions on the right
with zeros:

```
  0000 0101  (5)
  << 1
  0000 1010  (10)

  0000 0101  (5)
  << 3
  0010 1000  (40)
```

Each left shift by 1 **multiplies the value by 2**. Shifting left by `n` is the
same as multiplying by 2^n^:

```cpp
int x = 5;
int doubled  = x << 1;   // 10  (5 × 2)
int times8   = x << 3;   // 40  (5 × 2 × 2 × 2)
```

### Right Shift: `>>`

Right shift moves every bit to the right. For unsigned values, zeros fill in
from the left. For signed values, the sign bit is copied (called **arithmetic
shift**), so negative numbers stay negative after a right shift.

```
  0010 1000  (40)
  >> 1
  0001 0100  (20)

  0010 1000  (40)
  >> 3
  0000 0101  (5)
```

Each right shift by 1 **divides the value by 2** (discarding any remainder).
Shifting right by `n` is the same as dividing by 2^n^:

```cpp
int y = 40;
int halved    = y >> 1;   // 20  (40 / 2)
int div8      = y >> 3;   // 5   (40 / 8)
```

### What About Odd Numbers?

When you right-shift an odd number, the lowest bit is lost — just like integer
division discards the remainder:

```cpp
int odd = 7;
int result = odd >> 1;  // 3, not 3.5 (same as 7 / 2)
```

### Compound Assignment

As with other operators, there are compound assignment forms:

```cpp
int flags = 1;
flags <<= 4;   // flags is now 16  (1 shifted left 4)
flags >>= 2;   // flags is now 4   (16 shifted right 2)
```

::: {.tip}
**Tip:** Shifting by a negative amount or by more bits than the type has is
**undefined behavior**. For a 32-bit `int`, valid shift amounts are 0 to 31.
:::

::: {.tip}
**Tip:** Modern compilers optimize multiplication and division by powers of two
into shift operations automatically. Write `x * 4` rather than `x << 2` unless
you are doing actual bit manipulation — it is clearer, and the compiler will
generate the same code.
:::

### Try It: Powers of Two with Shifts

This program uses shifts to compute and display powers of two:

```cpp
#include <print>

int main() {
    std::println("Powers of two using left shift:");
    for (int i = 0; i < 16; ++i) {
        int power = 1 << i;
        std::println("  1 << {:2} = {:5}  ({:#018b})", i, power, power);
    }

    std::println("\nDividing 1000 by powers of two using right shift:");
    int val = 1000;
    for (int i = 0; i <= 4; ++i) {
        std::println("  {} >> {} = {}", val, i, val >> i);
    }
}
```

## 9. Conclusion

Here are the key takeaways from this chapter:

- **A number is a number**, regardless of how you represent it. `42`, `0b101010`,
  `0x2A`, and `052` are all the same value.
- **Decimal, binary, hex, and octal** are just different bases. Each one makes
  certain patterns easier to see.
- **C++ supports multiple bases** in literals (`0b`, `0x`, `0`), output
  (`{:b}`, `{:x}`, `{:o}`), and conversion (`std::stoi` with a base parameter).
- **Converting between strings and numbers** is straightforward with `std::stoi`,
  `std::stod`, and `std::to_string`. The `pos` parameter tells you where
  parsing stopped, and the base parameter lets you parse hex, binary, and octal.
- **A byte is 8 bits**, and integer types come in different sizes — from 1-byte
  `char` to 8-byte `long long`. The number of bits determines the range of
  values a type can hold.
- **Two's complement** is how computers represent negative integers. It
  eliminates the double-zero problem and lets addition and subtraction share the
  same hardware.
- **Signed overflow is undefined behavior**, but unsigned overflow wraps around
  predictably. Be careful with arithmetic near the limits of a type.
- **Shift operators** (`<<`, `>>`) move bits and are equivalent to multiplying
  and dividing by powers of two.

A number can wear many different outfits, but underneath, es el mismo numero.
No te preocupes — you have got this. Nos vemos en el proximo capitulo!
