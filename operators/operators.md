# Operators

You have already used several operators without thinking much about them. In
Chapter 1, you used `::` (the scope resolution operator) to call `std::println`. In
Chapter 2, you used `=` to assign values to variables and `>>` to extract input from
`std::cin`. You have compared values with `==` and `<`. This chapter takes a closer
look at all the operators C++ offers, starting with the ones you know and building up
to the ones you have not seen yet.

## 1. Math Operators

### Assignment: `=`

You have used `=` since Chapter 2 to give values to variables:

```cpp
int score = 100;
```

> **Tip:** Technically, `int score = 100;` is **initialization**, not assignment. You
> learned about initialization with `{}` in Chapter 2. Assignment happens when you
> change a variable that already exists, like `score = 200;`. The distinction matters
> more as you get deeper into C++, but for now just know they are not the same thing.

One useful property of `=` is that it returns the value it assigned. This lets you chain
assignments together:

```cpp
int a, b;
a = b = 3;  // b gets 3, then a gets 3
```

The chain is evaluated right-to-left: `b` is assigned `3` first, and that result (`3`) is then
assigned to `a`.

### Arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`

These work as you would expect from math class:

```cpp
int x = 10 + 3;   // 13
int y = 10 - 3;   // 7
int z = 10 * 3;   // 30
int w = 10 / 3;   // 3, not 3.333!
```

Watch out for integer division. When both operands are integers, `/` discards the
remainder. If you need a decimal result, use `double`:

```cpp
double precise = 10.0 / 3.0;  // 3.33333...
```

### Modulus: `%`

The modulus operator `%` gives you the remainder after division. It works only with
integers.

```cpp
int remainder = 10 % 3;  // 1, because 10 / 3 = 3 remainder 1
```

Modulus is surprisingly useful. A common use is checking whether a number is even
or odd:

```cpp
if (number % 2 == 0) {
    std::println("Even");
} else {
    std::println("Odd");
}
```

You can also use it for wrapping, like a clock. Hours wrap around after 12:

```cpp
int hour = 15 % 12;  // 3
```

Or extracting digits from a number:

```cpp
int last_digit = 1985 % 10;   // 5
int last_two   = 1985 % 100;  // 85
```

### Increment and Decrement: `++`, `--`

You first saw `++` in Chapter 4, where it was used to count through arrays. Adding
one to a variable is so common that C++ gives you a shortcut. In fact, the `++` in
C++ comes from this operator.

There are two forms. **Prefix** increments first, then returns the new value:

```cpp
int x = 5;
int y = ++x;  // x is now 6, y is 6
```

**Postfix** returns the current value first, then increments:

```cpp
int x = 5;
int y = x++;  // y is 5, x is now 6
```

The decrement operator `--` works the same way but subtracts one.

> **Tip:** In loops and standalone statements, prefer prefix (`++i`) over postfix
> (`i++`). For integers the difference is negligible, but with iterators and other
> types, prefix can be more efficient because it avoids creating a temporary copy.

### Compound Assignment: `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`

When you want to update a variable based on its current value, compound assignment
keeps your code concise:

```cpp
int score = 100;
score += 10;   // same as: score = score + 10;  -> 110
score -= 25;   // same as: score = score - 25;  -> 85
score *= 2;    // same as: score = score * 2;   -> 170
score /= 5;    // same as: score = score / 5;   -> 34
score %= 10;   // same as: score = score % 10;  -> 4
```

These are especially handy for running totals and accumulators:

```cpp
double total{};
for (const auto price : prices) {
    total += price;
}
```

### A Note on Precedence

Multiplication, division, and modulus are evaluated before addition and subtraction,
just like in math class. When in doubt, use parentheses to make your intent clear:

```cpp
int result = 2 + 3 * 4;      // 14, not 20
int clear  = 2 + (3 * 4);    // 14, same thing but obvious
int other  = (2 + 3) * 4;    // 20
```

## 2. Comparison Operators

You have seen these since Chapter 2. Each comparison returns a `bool` — either
`true` or `false`:

```cpp
int a = 5, b = 10;
bool eq = (a == b);   // false  — equal to
bool ne = (a != b);   // true   — not equal to
bool lt = (a < b);    // true   — less than
bool le = (a <= b);   // true   — less than or equal to
bool gt = (a > b);    // false  — greater than
bool ge = (a >= b);   // false  — greater than or equal to
```

These are straightforward, but there is one trap that catches nearly everyone at
least once.

> **Tip:** Do not confuse `=` (assignment) with `==` (comparison). The expression
> `if (x = 5)` does not check whether `x` equals `5`. It *assigns* `5` to `x`, and since
> `5` is nonzero (truthy), the condition is always true. This is a legal C++ statement,
> so the compiler may not warn you. Always double-check that you used `==` in
> conditions.

> **Tip:** C++20 introduced the **three-way comparison operator** `<=>`, sometimes
> called the "spaceship operator." It compares two values and tells you whether the
> left side is less than, equal to, or greater than the right side — all in one operation.
> You can safely ignore it for now, but you may see it in modern C++ code.

## 3. Logical Operators

Logical operators combine or invert `bool` values. You use them to build more
complex conditions.

### AND: `&&`

Both conditions must be true:

```cpp
if (age >= 18 && has_ticket) {
    std::println("Bienvenido al concierto!");
}
```

### OR: `||`

At least one condition must be true:

```cpp
if (day == "Saturday" || day == "Sunday") {
    std::println("Fin de semana");
}
```

### NOT: `!`

Inverts a boolean value:

```cpp
if (!game_over) {
    std::println("Keep playing");
}
```

### Short-Circuit Evaluation

C++ evaluates logical expressions left-to-right and stops as soon as the result is
determined. With `&&`, if the left side is `false`, the right side is never evaluated.
With `||`, if the left side is `true`, the right side is skipped. This is useful for
guarding against errors:

```cpp
if (index < size && data[index] > 0) {
    // safe: data[index] is only accessed if index is valid
}
```

> **Tip:** Do not confuse `&&` and `||` (logical) with `&` and `|` (bitwise). The
> bitwise versions operate on individual bits and do *not* short-circuit. Using `&`
> when you meant `&&` can cause subtle bugs and unexpected behavior.

### Precedence

`!` has the highest precedence of the three, followed by `&&`, then `||`. Use
parentheses to make complex conditions readable:

```cpp
// Without parentheses — && binds tighter than ||
if (is_vip || age >= 21 && has_id) { ... }

// Clearer with parentheses
if (is_vip || (age >= 21 && has_id)) { ... }
```

## 4. The Ternary Operator: `?:`

Sometimes you need a simple either-or value. An `if/else` block works, but the
ternary operator gives you a compact one-liner:

```cpp
condition ? value_if_true : value_if_false
```

For example:

```cpp
int score = 85;
std::string result = (score >= 60) ? "Passed" : "Failed";
std::println("{}", result);  // Passed
```

It is handy for quick assignments:

```cpp
std::string greeting = (hora < 12) ? "Buenos dias" : "Buenas tardes";
```

> **Tip:** Avoid nesting ternary operators. An expression like
> `a ? b : c ? d : e` is hard to read. Use `if/else` when the logic gets more
> complex than a single condition.

## 5. Bitwise Operators

Bitwise operators work on the individual bits of integer values. Before diving in,
here is a quick refresher on binary.

### Binary Numbers

Computers store numbers in binary — base 2. Each digit is a **bit** that is either `0`
or `1`. An 8-bit number looks like this:

```
Bit position:   7   6   5   4   3   2   1   0
Value:        128  64  32  16   8   4   2   1
```

For example, the number `42` in binary is `00101010`:

```
0*128 + 0*64 + 1*32 + 0*16 + 1*8 + 0*4 + 1*2 + 0*1 = 42
```

### Bitwise AND: `&`

Each bit in the result is `1` only if both corresponding bits are `1`.

```cpp
//   0b00101010  (42)
// & 0b00001111  (15)
// = 0b00001010  (10)
int masked = 42 & 0x0F;  // 10
```

**Common use:** masking — extracting specific bits from a value.

### Bitwise OR: `|`

Each bit in the result is `1` if either corresponding bit is `1`.

```cpp
//   0b00001010  (10)
// | 0b11000000  (192)
// = 0b11001010  (202)
int flags = 10 | 192;  // 202
```

**Common use:** setting bits, combining flags.

### Bitwise XOR: `^`

Each bit in the result is `1` if the corresponding bits are *different*.

```cpp
//   0b00101010  (42)
// ^ 0b00001111  (15)
// = 0b00100101  (37)
int toggled = 42 ^ 15;  // 37
```

**Common use:** toggling (flipping) specific bits.

### Bitwise NOT: `~`

Inverts every bit. A `0` becomes `1` and a `1` becomes `0`.

```cpp
// ~0b00000000 = 0b11111111  (for 8 bits)
unsigned char flipped = ~0;  // 255
```

> **Tip:** Be careful with `~` on signed types. The result depends on the size
> of the type and can produce negative values due to two's complement
> representation.

### Left Shift: `<<` and Right Shift: `>>`

Shifting moves bits left or right by a given number of positions.

```cpp
int val = 1;
int shifted_left  = val << 3;  // 8  (1 * 2^3)
int shifted_right = 8 >> 2;    // 2  (8 / 2^2)
```

Left shifting by `n` is equivalent to multiplying by `2^n`. Right shifting by `n` is
equivalent to dividing by `2^n` (for unsigned values).

**Common use:** efficient multiplication/division by powers of two, and
positioning bits in flags or registers.

### Compound Assignment Forms

Just like the arithmetic operators, each bitwise operator has a compound form:

```cpp
int flags = 0b00000000;
flags |= 0b00000100;   // set bit 2        -> 0b00000100
flags &= 0b11111100;   // clear bits 0-1   -> 0b00000100
flags ^= 0b00000100;   // toggle bit 2     -> 0b00000000
flags <<= 2;            // shift left by 2
flags >>= 1;            // shift right by 1
```

> **Tip:** Bitwise operators have surprisingly low precedence — lower than `==`.
> The expression `x & 0xFF == 0` is parsed as `x & (0xFF == 0)`, which is almost
> certainly not what you want. Always use parentheses with bitwise operators:
> `(x & 0xFF) == 0`.

## 6. Other Operators

You will encounter a few more operators as you progress through the textbook.
Here is a brief overview:

- **`sizeof`** — returns the size of a type or variable in bytes: `sizeof(int)`
- **`()`** — function call (Chapter 1) and grouping for precedence
- **`[]`** — array subscript (Chapter 4): `numbers[0]`
- **`.`** and **`->`** — member access (Chapter 10): `stock.price` or `ptr->price`
- **`*`** and **`&`** (unary) — dereference and address-of (Chapter 12)
- **`,`** — the comma operator evaluates two expressions and returns the second.
  You will rarely need it, and it can make code confusing. Avoid it.
- **`::`** — scope resolution (Chapter 1): `std::println`

Each of these will be covered in detail when you reach the relevant chapter.

## 7. Operator Overloading

Sometimes the same operator does different things depending on the types involved.
This is called **operator overloading**, and you have been using it since Chapter 1.

The `+` operator adds numbers, but with `std::string` it concatenates:

```cpp
int sum = 5 + 3;  // 8

std::string song = "Take On "s + "Me"s;  // "Take On Me"
```

The `<<` operator is a bitwise left shift for integers, but with `std::cout` it is the
stream insertion operator:

```cpp
int shifted = 1 << 4;           // 16 (bitwise shift)
std::cout << "Hola, mundo!\n";  // stream insertion
```

Similarly, `>>` is both bitwise right shift and the stream extraction operator you use
with `std::cin`:

```cpp
int half = 8 >> 1;        // 4 (bitwise shift)
std::cin >> number;        // stream extraction
```

In Chapter 15, you will see how to define `operator==` for your own custom types.
For now, just be aware that an operator's meaning depends on what it is applied to.

> **Tip:** When you see an unfamiliar use of an operator, check what types the
> operands are. The type determines which version of the operator is called.

## 8. Precedence

When an expression has multiple operators, C++ uses **precedence** rules to decide
which operator is evaluated first. Higher precedence means the operator is applied
earlier. Here is the full table:

| Precedence | Operator | Description | Associativity |
|:---:|:---|:---|:---:|
| 1 | `::` | Scope resolution | Left-to-right |
| 2 | `()` `[]` `.` `->` `++` `--` | Function call, subscript, member access, postfix inc/dec, casts | Left-to-right |
| 3 | `++` `--` `+` `-` `!` `~` `*` `&` | Prefix inc/dec, unary plus/minus, logical NOT, bitwise NOT, deref, address-of | Right-to-left |
| 5 | `*` `/` `%` | Multiplication, division, modulus | Left-to-right |
| 6 | `+` `-` | Addition, subtraction | Left-to-right |
| 7 | `<<` `>>` | Bitwise left and right shift | Left-to-right |
| 8 | `<` `<=` `>` `>=` | Relational operators | Left-to-right |
| 9 | `==` `!=` | Equality and inequality | Left-to-right |
| 10 | `&` | Bitwise AND | Left-to-right |
| 11 | `^` | Bitwise XOR | Left-to-right |
| 12 | `\|` | Bitwise OR | Left-to-right |
| 13 | `&&` | Logical AND | Left-to-right |
| 14 | `\|\|` | Logical OR | Left-to-right |
| 15 | `?:` `=` `+=` `-=` `*=` `/=` `%=` `<<=` `>>=` `&=` `^=` `\|=` | Ternary, assignment, compound assignment | Right-to-left |
| 16 | `,` | Comma operator | Left-to-right |

### How to Read the Table

A **lower precedence number** means the operator binds more tightly. Operators at
precedence 5 (`*`, `/`, `%`) are evaluated before operators at precedence 6 (`+`, `-`).
That is why `2 + 3 * 4` equals `14`, not `20`.

**Associativity** tells you the direction when operators of the *same* precedence appear
together. Most operators are left-to-right:

```cpp
int val = 10 - 3 - 2;  // (10 - 3) - 2 = 5, not 10 - (3 - 2) = 9
```

Assignment operators are right-to-left, which is why chaining works:

```cpp
a = b = 3;  // b = 3 first, then a = 3
```

Here is a quick example putting it together:

```cpp
int result = 2 + 3 * 4 > 10 && true;
// Step 1: 3 * 4 = 12        (precedence 5)
// Step 2: 2 + 12 = 14       (precedence 6)
// Step 3: 14 > 10 = true    (precedence 8)
// Step 4: true && true       (precedence 13)
// result = 1 (true)
```

> **Tip:** You do not need to memorize this table. When you are unsure about
> the order, add parentheses. They make your intent obvious to both the compiler
> and anyone reading your code. A few extra `()` are far better than a subtle bug.

## Conclusion

Operators are the building blocks of expressions in C++. Here are the key takeaways
from this chapter:

- **Use `==` for comparison, not `=`.** This is the most common operator mistake in
  C++. Train yourself to double-check conditions.
- **Use parentheses when in doubt.** Precedence rules are hard to memorize, and
  `()` makes your intent clear to both the compiler and the next person reading your
  code.
- **Do not confuse logical and bitwise operators.** `&&` and `||` short-circuit and
  work with boolean logic. `&` and `|` operate on individual bits.
- **Operators can be overloaded.** The same symbol can mean different things
  depending on the types involved. When something looks unfamiliar, check the
  types.

You now have a solid understanding of how C++ operators work. As you continue
through the textbook, you will see these operators everywhere — in loops, conditions,
function calls, and class definitions. With practice, reading and writing expressions will become second nature.
No te preocupes — you have got this. Nos vemos en el proximo capitulo!
