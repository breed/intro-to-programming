# Author Intro

C was the first programming language i truly loved!
i had taught myself BASIC and Z80 assembly, and later i learned Pascal and VAX assembly for college.
i liked VAX assembly.
it was at my internship that i was handed `The C Programming Language` K&R that i realized how much i could love a language.
i also learned FORTRAN 77 at that internship. i do NOT like FORTRAN.

C has a simplicity about it that makes it easy to jump into.
it has a rawness that lets you really control what is happening in your program and consequently shoot yourself in the foot.
the really great thing about C is that it gives you visibility into what really happens when your code executes that is only surpassed by assembly but without the verbosity and awkward constructs of working with assembly.

this booklet is to be experimented with.
if you want a book to read, these are not the droids you are looking for.
if you want something to introduce you to key concepts of C with some pointers for experiments you can try yourself, read on and write some code!
programming is learned by writing code; there is just no other way that comes close to it.
not everyone starts out as a great programmer, but everyone can become one by writing code either from scratch or by modifying code of others.

i hope this booklet will be something that can help you learn to love the challenge/satisfaction/power/rewards that come with being a great programmer.

# 0. How to use this booklet

This is a short booklet to help a C++ programmer get up to speed with C.
As a side benefit, you will probably find that you understand C++ better at the end of it.

Each chapter is meant to help you understand a topic, but you will still want to reference API descriptions for more specifics of the parameters and operating conditions.
Hopefully, you'll have the context you need to understand API documentation.

## Tips

**Tips** call out details that you need to pay special attention to.
**Traps** warn you of common mistakes made.
**Wut** calls out a detail that is counter-intuitive, so make sure you pay attention.

## Try It

As the intro to the most amazing programming language book ever written starts out:

> The only way to learn a new programming language is by writing programs in it.

You need to write some code.
Make sure you try writing some programs from scratch.
At the end of most sections is a starter program that you can type in and modify to play with.
Don't use it as an excuse to avoid writing some of your own starter programs.
It's the only way to master a language.

## Exercises

Don't skip the exercises at the end of the chapters.
You can get the answer key, but don't look at the answer key before you work out the answer yourself.
If you look at the answer key first, the concepts will not sink in.

# 1. Introduction

In the beginning, knowing C++ automatically meant you knew C. The original C++
compiler, `cfront`, literally translated C++ code into C before compiling it.
But modern C++ has diverged dramatically from C. You have `std::string`,
`std::vector`, smart pointers, RAII, templates, `iostream`, and exceptions — none
of which exist in C. If someone hands you a C codebase today, your modern C++
instincts will not get you very far.

So why learn C? Because C is everywhere. Operating systems, embedded firmware,
database engines, language runtimes — the foundational software that the world
runs on is written in C. Even if you spend most of your career in C++, you will
encounter C code, C libraries, and C APIs. Understanding C makes you a better
programmer, period.

My go-to C textbook is *The C Programming Language (Second Edition)* by Brian
Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie — often called "K&R." It is one of the most
influential programming books ever written, and it opens like this:

> ## Getting Started
>
> The only way to learn a new programming language is by writing programs in it.
> The first program to write is the same for all languages: Print the words
> hello, world. This is the big hurdle; to leap over it you have to be able to
> create the program text somewhere, compile it successfully, load it, run it,
> and find out where your output went. With these mechanical details mastered,
> everything else is comparatively easy.
>
> In C, the program to print "hello, world" is
>
> ```c
> #include <stdio.h>
> main()
> {
>     printf("hello, world\n");
> }
> ```
>
> Just how to run this program depends on the system you are using. As a
> specific example, on the UNIX operating system you must create the program in
> a file whose name ends in ".c", such as hello.c, then compile it with the
> command `cc hello.c`. If you haven't botched anything, such as omitting a
> character or misspelling something, the compilation will proceed silently, and
> make an executable file called a.out. If you run a.out by typing the command
> `a.out`, it will print `hello, world`. On other systems, the rules will be
> different; check with a local expert.

## Differences Summary

\index{stdio.h}
Notice the differences from C++. There is no `#include <iostream>`, no
`std::println`, no `std::cout`. In C, you use `printf` from `<stdio.h>` for
output. The file ends in `.c`, not `.cpp`. You compile with `cc` (the C
compiler) rather than `c++`.

Here is a quick summary of the biggest differences you will encounter:

| C++ | C |
|:---|:---|
| `std::string` | `char` arrays with `'\0'` |
| `std::vector` | raw arrays or `malloc` |
| `std::cout` / `std::println` | `printf` |
| `std::cin` | `scanf` |
| `new` / `delete` | `malloc` / `free` |
| Smart pointers | Raw pointers (only option) |
| Classes and objects | Structs and functions |
| References (`&`) | Pointers (`*`) |
| `bool` (built-in) | `_Bool` or `#include <stdbool.h>` |
| `// comments` | `/* comments */` (C89); `//` allowed since C99 |

::: {.tip}
\index{cc (compiler)}
**Tip:** C source files use the `.c` extension and are compiled with `cc`. If
you accidentally compile a `.c` file with `c++`, it will be treated as C++ and
may accept syntax that real C compilers reject. Always use `cc` when writing C.
:::

## Printing with `printf`

\index{printf}

```c
int printf(const char *format, ...);
```

In C++, you use `std::cout` or `std::println` for output. In C, you use
`printf` from `<stdio.h>`. Unlike `std::println`, `printf` does not
automatically add a newline at the end of the output. If you want each call to
end on its own line, you must include `\n` in the format string yourself.

The first argument to `printf` is a **format string** containing literal text
and **format specifiers** that start with `%`. Each specifier is replaced by the
corresponding argument that follows:

```c
int year = 1984;
printf("Year: %d\n", year);   // Year: 1984
```

\index{format specifier}
Here are the format specifiers you will use most:

| Specifier | Type | Example | Output |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| `%d` | `int` (decimal) | `printf("%d", 42)` | `42` |
| `%x` | `int` (hex, lowercase) | `printf("%x", 255)` | `ff` |
| `%X` | `int` (hex, uppercase) | `printf("%X", 255)` | `FF` |
| `%f` | `double` | `printf("%f", 3.14)` | `3.140000` |
| `%e` | `double` (scientific) | `printf("%e", 3.14)` | `3.140000e+00` |
| `%c` | `char` | `printf("%c", 'A')` | `A` |
| `%s` | `char *` (string) | `printf("%s", "hola")` | `hola` |
| `%p` | pointer | `printf("%p", (void *)ptr)` | `0x7ffd...` |
| `%zu` | `size_t` | `printf("%zu", sizeof(int))` | `4` |

::: {.tip}
**Trap:** The first argument to `printf` should always be a string literal.
Never pass a variable as the first argument.
It may work, but it is a potential security vulnerability (format string attack).
If you only want to print a string variable, don't do ~~`printf(str)`~~, do `printf("%s", str)`.
:::

You can control the width and precision of output by placing numbers between the
`%` and the specifier letter. A number before the specifier sets the minimum
field width, and a `.` followed by a number sets the precision (decimal places
for floats, max characters for strings):

```c
double score = 98.6;
printf("Score: %f\n", score);      // 98.600000  (default: 6 decimal places)
printf("Score: %.2f\n", score);    // 98.60      (2 decimal places)
printf("Score: %e\n", score);      // 9.860000e+01 (scientific notation)
```

**Zero-filled output** is useful for track numbers, timestamps, and hex
addresses. Place a `0` before the width to pad with zeros instead of spaces:

```c
for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    printf("Track %02d\n", i);
}
// Track 01
// Track 02
// Track 03
// Track 04
// Track 05

int color = 0xFF8800;
printf("Color: 0x%06X\n", color);   // Color: 0xFF8800

int score = 95;
printf("Score: %d%%\n", score);      // Score: 95%
```

**Since `%` introduces a format specifier, you must write `%%` to print a literal
percent sign.**

::: {.tip}
**Trap:** `printf` does not check that your format specifiers match the types of
your arguments. If you write `printf("%d", 3.14)`, the compiler may warn you,
but it will not stop you. The result is garbage. Always match specifiers to
types: `%d` for `int`, `%f` for `double`, `%s` for `char *`, and so on.
:::

## Try It: printf Starter

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    // Basic format specifiers
    printf("Integer: %d\n", 1984);
    printf("Hex:     %x (lowercase)  %X (uppercase)\n", 255, 255);
    printf("Float:   %f\n", 3.14);
    printf("Sci:     %e\n", 3.14);
    printf("Char:    %c\n", 'A');
    printf("String:  %s\n", "Hola");

    // Width and precision
    printf("\nFormatted output:\n");
    for (int i = 1; i <= 3; i++)
        printf("  Track %02d\n", i);

    printf("  Pi: %.2f\n", 3.14159);
    printf("  100%% complete\n");

    return 0;
}
```

## Key Points

- C uses `printf` from `<stdio.h>` for output — there is no `std::cout` or
  `std::println`.
- Format specifiers (`%d`, `%s`, `%f`, etc.) must match the types of the
  arguments passed to `printf`.
- C source files end in `.c` and are compiled with `cc`, not `c++`.
- C has no classes, no templates, no exceptions, no smart pointers, and no
  `std::string`.
- `printf` does not add a newline automatically — you must include `\n`
  yourself.

## Exercises

1. **Think about it:** C uses format specifiers in `printf` while C++ uses
   `operator<<` or `std::format`. What advantage does the format string
   approach give you when writing output to a log file? What is a disadvantage?

2. **What does this print?**

    ```c
    printf("%05d %x\n", 42, 255);
    ```

3. **Calculation:** How many bytes does the string literal `"hello"` occupy in
   memory?

4. **Where is the bug?**

    ```c
    double pi = 3.14159;
    printf("Pi is %d\n", pi);
    ```

5. **Write a program** that prints a 5x5 multiplication table using `printf`
   with width formatting so the columns are aligned.

# 2. Variables

In C++, you have `auto` to let the compiler figure out types, `std::string` to
handle text, and classes to bundle data with behavior. In C, none of that
exists. Every type is explicit, strings are raw character arrays, and if you
want to group data together, you use a `struct` with no member functions. This
chapter covers how C handles variables — from basic types and arrays to
pointers, `const`, and structures.

## Basic Types

\index{types}

C provides a small set of built-in types. There are no classes, no
`std::string`, and no `bool` keyword (without a header). Here are the types you
will use most:

| Type | Typical Size | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `char` | 1 byte | A single character (or small integer) |
| `short` | 2 bytes | Short integer |
| `int` | 4 bytes | Standard integer |
| `long` | 4 or 8 bytes | Long integer (platform-dependent) |
| `long long` | 8 bytes | At least 64-bit integer |
| `float` | 4 bytes | Single-precision floating point |
| `double` | 8 bytes | Double-precision floating point |
| `_Bool` | 1 byte | Boolean (C99); use `bool` via `<stdbool.h>` |

\index{unsigned}
Each integer type has an `unsigned` variant that stores only non-negative
values, giving you twice the positive range. For example, a `signed char` holds
-128 to 127, while an `unsigned char` holds 0 to 255:

```c
unsigned char brightness = 255;
unsigned int count = 4000000000U;
```

::: {.tip}
**Tip:** C99 added `<stdbool.h>`, which defines `bool`, `true`, and `false`.
Without it, you must use `_Bool` for the type and integer values `0` and `1`.
Most modern C code includes `<stdbool.h>` and uses `bool` just like C++.
:::

\index{stdbool.h}

```c
#include <stdbool.h>

bool done = false;
if (!done) {
    /* keep going */
}
```

## Variables as Named Memory

\index{variable}

A variable declaration does two things: it allocates a region of memory large
enough to hold the declared type, and it gives that region a name. The amount of
memory allocated depends on the type:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    char letter = 'J';
    int year = 1981;
    double rating = 9.5;

    printf("char:   %zu bytes\n", sizeof(letter));   // 1
    printf("int:    %zu bytes\n", sizeof(year));      // 4
    printf("double: %zu bytes\n", sizeof(rating));    // 8

    return 0;
}
```

\index{sizeof}
The `sizeof` operator returns the size in bytes of a type or variable. It
evaluates at compile time, so there is no runtime cost. You can use it with a
type name or with a variable:

```c
printf("int is %zu bytes\n", sizeof(int));
printf("year is %zu bytes\n", sizeof(year));
```

::: {.tip}
**Tip:** `sizeof` returns a value of type `size_t`. Always use `%zu` to print
it. Using `%d` is technically undefined behavior, even though it often appears
to work.
:::

## typedef

\index{typedef}

The `typedef` keyword creates an alias for an existing type. It does not create
a new type — it just gives you a shorter or more descriptive name:

```c
typedef unsigned long ulong;
typedef unsigned char byte;

ulong population = 4000000000UL;
byte channel = 83;
```

One of the most common uses of `typedef` is to simplify struct declarations.
Without `typedef`, you must write `struct` every time you use the type:

```c
struct point {
    double x;
    double y;
};

struct point origin;   /* must say "struct point" every time */
```

With `typedef`, you can drop the `struct` keyword:

```c
typedef struct {
    double x;
    double y;
} Point;

Point origin = {0.0, 0.0};   /* much cleaner */
```

::: {.tip}
**Tip:** In C++, you can use a struct name directly as a type. In C, you cannot
— you must either write `struct name` every time or use `typedef` to create an
alias. Most C codebases use `typedef` for any struct that appears frequently.
:::

## Pointer Declarations

\index{pointer!declaration}

A pointer variable holds the address of another variable. You declare a pointer
by placing `*` after the base type:

```c
int score = 100;
int *p = &score;   /* p holds the address of score */
```

The type before the `*` tells the compiler what kind of data lives at that
address. An `int *` points to an `int`, a `char *` points to a `char`, and so
on.

We will not go deeper into pointers here. The Pointers chapter covers
dereferencing, pointer arithmetic, pointers to pointers, and how pointers
interact with arrays and structures in detail.

## Arrays

\index{array}

An array is a fixed-size sequence of elements of the same type, declared with
`[]`:

```c
int scores[5];                          /* 5 uninitialized ints */
int primes[5] = {2, 3, 5, 7, 11};      /* initialized */
char greeting[] = "Hola";              /* compiler counts: 5 chars (including '\0') */
```

When you provide an initializer, the compiler can determine the size for you, so
you can leave the brackets empty.

### The "Value" of an Array Name

\index{array!decay to pointer}

In most expressions, the name of an array evaluates to the address of its first
element. This is called **decay** — the array "decays" into a pointer:

```c
int primes[5] = {2, 3, 5, 7, 11};
int *p = primes;    /* p points to primes[0]; no & needed */
```

This is why you can pass an array to a function that expects a pointer. The
Pointers chapter will explore this relationship thoroughly.

::: {.tip}
**Wut:** The `sizeof` operator is one of the few contexts where an array does
*not* decay to a pointer. `sizeof(primes)` gives the total size of the array
(20 bytes for 5 ints), not the size of a pointer.
:::

### Initialization

You can partially initialize an array — remaining elements are set to zero:

```c
int totals[10] = {1, 2, 3};   /* totals[3] through totals[9] are 0 */
int zeros[100] = {0};          /* all 100 elements are 0 */
```

### Multidimensional Arrays

\index{array!multidimensional}

C supports multidimensional arrays. A two-dimensional array is really an array
of arrays, stored in **row-major** order — all elements of row 0 come first,
then all elements of row 1, and so on:

```c
int grid[3][4] = {
    {1,  2,  3,  4},
    {5,  6,  7,  8},
    {9, 10, 11, 12}
};
```

In memory, this is stored as: `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12` — twelve
consecutive integers. The expression `grid[r][c]` accesses row `r`, column `c`.

Iterating through a 2D array:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    int grid[3][4] = {
        {1,  2,  3,  4},
        {5,  6,  7,  8},
        {9, 10, 11, 12}
    };

    for (int r = 0; r < 3; r++) {
        for (int c = 0; c < 4; c++) {
            printf("%3d", grid[r][c]);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }
    return 0;
}
```

::: {.tip}
**Trap:** When passing a multidimensional array to a function, you must specify
all dimensions except the first. The compiler needs the column count to
calculate offsets:

```c
void print_grid(int grid[][4], int rows);   /* OK — column size specified */
```

You cannot write `int grid[][]` — the compiler would not know how wide each row
is.
:::

## const

\index{const}

The `const` qualifier marks a variable as read-only. Any attempt to modify it is
a compile-time error:

```c
const int MAX_TRACKS = 12;
const double PI = 3.14159265358979;
```

### const with Pointers

\index{const!with pointers}

Things get interesting when `const` meets pointers. There are three
combinations, and the **read right-to-left** rule helps you decode them:

**Pointer to const data** — you cannot modify the data through this pointer, but
you can change where the pointer points:

```c
const int *p = &x;
*p = 10;      /* ERROR: cannot modify data through p */
p = &y;       /* OK: p itself can change */
```

Read right-to-left: `p` is a pointer (`*`) to `int` that is `const`. The data
is const, not the pointer.

**const pointer to data** — the pointer itself cannot change, but you can modify
the data it points to:

```c
int *const p = &x;
*p = 10;      /* OK: data can be modified */
p = &y;       /* ERROR: p itself is const */
```

Read right-to-left: `p` is a `const` pointer (`*`) to `int`. The pointer is
const, not the data.

**const pointer to const data** — neither the pointer nor the data can change:

```c
const int *const p = &x;
*p = 10;      /* ERROR */
p = &y;       /* ERROR */
```

::: {.tip}
**Tip:** The most common form is `const int *p` — a pointer through which you
promise not to modify the data. You will see this constantly in function
parameters, like `const char *msg`, where the function reads the data but does
not change it.
:::

## Structures

\index{struct}

A `struct` groups related variables together under one name. If you come from
C++, think of a struct as a class with only public data members — no member
functions, no constructors, no destructors, and no access specifiers:

```c
struct song {
    char title[40];
    int year;
};
```

### Declaring and Initializing

To declare a variable of a struct type, you write `struct` followed by the tag
name:

```c
struct song track;
track.year = 1981;
```

You can also initialize at declaration time:

```c
struct song track = {"I Love Rock 'n' Roll", 1981};
```

With a `typedef`, you can skip the `struct` keyword:

```c
typedef struct {
    char title[40];
    int year;
} Song;

Song track = {"I Love Rock 'n' Roll", 1981};
```

### Accessing Members

\index{struct!member access}

Use the `.` operator to access members:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    struct song {
        char title[40];
        int year;
    };

    struct song track = {"I Love Rock 'n' Roll", 1981};

    printf("Title: %s\n", track.title);   // I Love Rock 'n' Roll
    printf("Year: %d\n", track.year);     // 1981

    return 0;
}
```

### Assignment Copies

\index{struct!assignment}

Assigning one struct to another copies the entire contents — every byte:

```c
struct song original = {"I Love Rock 'n' Roll", 1981};
struct song copy = original;

printf("%s (%d)\n", copy.title, copy.year);   // I Love Rock 'n' Roll (1981)
```

This is a **shallow copy**. If the struct contained a pointer, both copies would
point to the same memory. For structs that contain only arrays and plain values
(like `struct song` above), the copy is complete and independent.

::: {.tip}
**Wut:** Unlike C++, there is no copy constructor or `operator=` to customize
what happens during assignment. C copies the raw bytes, period. If your struct
contains a pointer to dynamically allocated memory, the copy will share that
memory, leading to double-free bugs if you are not careful.
:::

### No Member Functions

In C++, you might write:

```cpp
class Song {
public:
    void print() { std::cout << title << " (" << year << ")\n"; }
    // ...
};
```

In C, structs cannot have member functions. Instead, you write standalone
functions that take a pointer to the struct:

```c
void song_print(const struct song *s) {
    printf("%s (%d)\n", s->title, s->year);
}
```

The `->` operator accesses a member through a pointer — it is shorthand for
`(*s).title`. We will cover this in detail in the Pointers chapter.

::: {.tip}
**Tip:** A common C pattern is to prefix functions with the struct name they
operate on: `song_print`, `song_init`, `song_compare`. This gives you something
like namespaced methods. Function pointers (covered in a later chapter) can even
be stored in structs to simulate virtual functions.

## Try It: Variables Starter

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdbool.h>

struct song {
    char title[40];
    int year;
};

int main(void) {
    /* Basic types and sizeof */
    char initial = 'J';
    int year = 1981;
    double rating = 9.5;
    bool classic = true;

    printf("=== Sizes ===\n");
    printf("char:   %zu byte\n", sizeof(initial));
    printf("int:    %zu bytes\n", sizeof(year));

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("scores[%d] = %d\n", i, scores[i]);

    const int MAX = 100;
    printf("\nMAX = %d\n", MAX);

    /* Struct */
    struct song track = {"I Love Rock 'n' Roll", 1981};
    printf("\n=== Struct ===\n");
    printf("Title: %s\n", track.title);
    printf("Year:  %d\n", track.year);
    printf("Size:  %zu bytes\n", sizeof(track));

    /* Struct copy */
    struct song backup = track;
    printf("Copy:  %s (%d)\n", backup.title, backup.year);

    /* 2D array */
    int grid[2][3] = {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}};
    printf("\n=== 2D Array ===\n");
    for (int r = 0; r < 2; r++) {
        for (int c = 0; c < 3; c++) {
            printf("%3d", grid[r][c]);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

## Key Points

- C has no `auto`, no `std::string`, and no classes. Every type is spelled out
  explicitly.
- A variable declaration allocates memory of the type's size and gives it a
  name. Use `sizeof` to see how many bytes each type occupies.
- `typedef` creates type aliases — especially useful for structs so you do not
  have to write `struct` everywhere.
- Arrays are fixed-size, and the array name decays to a pointer to the first
  element in most contexts.
- Multidimensional arrays are stored in row-major order. When passing them to
  functions, all dimensions except the first must be specified.
- `const` marks a variable as read-only. With pointers, read right-to-left to
  determine what is const — the data, the pointer, or both.
- Structs group data together but have no member functions, constructors, or
  access specifiers. Assignment copies the raw bytes.

## Exercises

1. **Think about it:** In C++, `auto x = 42;` lets the compiler deduce the
   type. C has no `auto` type deduction. What advantage does requiring explicit
   types give to someone reading unfamiliar C code?

2. **What does this print?**

    ```c
    int a[] = {10, 20, 30, 40};
    printf("%zu %zu\n", sizeof(a), sizeof(a[0]));
    ```

3. **Calculation:** Given the following declarations on a system where `int` is
   4 bytes, what is `sizeof(grid)`?

    ```c
    int grid[3][5];
    ```

4. **Where is the bug?**

    ```c
    const int MAX = 100;
    int *p = &MAX;
    *p = 200;
    printf("MAX = %d\n", MAX);
    ```

5. **What does this print?**

    ```c
    struct point { int x; int y; };
    struct point a = {3, 7};
    struct point b = a;
    b.x = 99;
    printf("%d %d\n", a.x, b.x);
    ```

6. **Think about it:** In C, assigning one struct to another copies the raw
   bytes. What problem could this cause if the struct contains a `char *` member
   that points to dynamically allocated memory (via `malloc`)? How is this
   different from what C++ does by default?

7. **Write a program** that declares a `struct student` with fields `name`
   (a `char` array), `id` (an `int`), and `gpa` (a `double`). Create an array
   of 3 students, initialize them with values, and print each student's
   information using a loop. Use `%s`, `%d`, and `%.2f` in your `printf`.

# 3. Expressions

C and C++ share most of their operators, and if you have been writing C++ you
will find the syntax immediately familiar. But there are important differences.
C has no operator overloading — `+` always means arithmetic addition, never
something a class author decided it should mean. The `<<` and `>>` operators are
strictly bitwise shifts, not I/O operations. And C uses `int` for boolean
results — there is no built-in `bool` type (though C99 added `_Bool` and
`<stdbool.h>`).

This chapter walks through the operators you will use every day in C, highlights
a few traps, and ends with the precedence table you will want to bookmark.

## Assignment

\index{assignment operator}

The `=` operator assigns a value to a variable. In C, assignment is an
**expression** — it produces a value, which is the value being assigned. This
lets you chain assignments:

```c
int a, b, c;
a = b = c = 0;   // all three are now 0
```

The chain works right to left: `c` gets `0`, then `b` gets the value of that
assignment (also `0`), then `a` gets the same.

Because assignment is an expression, you can (and sometimes will) use it inside
other expressions. A common pattern is assigning and testing a return value in
one step:

```c
int ch;
while ((ch = getchar()) != EOF) {
    putchar(ch);
}
```

\index{assignment!vs equality}

::: {.tip}
**Trap:** Because `=` is assignment and `==` is comparison, a common mistake is
writing `if (x = 5)` when you mean `if (x == 5)`. The first assigns `5` to `x`
and then evaluates as true (since `5` is nonzero). Modern compilers warn about
this, but it is still one of the most famous bugs in C:

```c
int x = 0;
if (x = 5) {
    printf("This always runs!\n");  // x is now 5, which is true
}
```

Some programmers write the constant on the left — `if (5 == x)` — so that
`if (5 = x)` would be a compiler error. This is called a **Yoda condition**.
:::

## Arithmetic Operators

\index{arithmetic operators}

The arithmetic operators work on numeric types just like in C++:

| Operator | Operation | Example | Result |
|:---:|:---|:---|:---|
| `+` | addition | `3 + 4` | `7` |
| `-` | subtraction | `10 - 3` | `7` |
| `*` | multiplication | `6 * 7` | `42` |
| `/` | division | `17 / 5` | `3` |
| `%` | remainder | `17 % 5` | `2` |

\index{integer division}
**Integer division** truncates toward zero. This means `17 / 5` gives `3`, not
`3.4`. If you want a floating-point result, at least one operand must be a
floating-point type:

```c
printf("%d\n", 17 / 5);       // 3
printf("%f\n", 17.0 / 5);     // 3.400000
```

\index{remainder operator (\%)}
The `%` operator gives the **remainder** after integer division. In C99 and
later, the result of `%` has the same sign as the dividend (the left operand):

```c
printf("%d\n",  17 %  5);   //  2
printf("%d\n", -17 %  5);   // -2
printf("%d\n",  17 % -5);   //  2
printf("%d\n", -17 % -5);   // -2
```

::: {.tip}
**Wut:** The `%` operator is often called "modulo," but it is technically the
**remainder** operator. For positive numbers, remainder and modulo are the same.
For negative numbers, they differ. In mathematics, modulo always returns a
non-negative result. In C, `%` preserves the sign of the dividend. If you need
a true modulo that always returns a non-negative value, you need to adjust the
result yourself:

```c
int mod(int a, int m) {
    int r = a % m;
    return r < 0 ? r + m : r;
}
```
:::

## Comparison and Logical Operators

\index{comparison operators}
\index{logical operators}

Comparison operators produce `1` for true and `0` for false. The result type is
`int`, not `bool`:

| Operator | Meaning |
|:---:|:---|
| `==` | equal to |
| `!=` | not equal to |
| `<` | less than |
| `>` | greater than |
| `<=` | less than or equal to |
| `>=` | greater than or equal to |

Logical operators combine boolean expressions:

| Operator | Meaning |
|:---:|:---|
| `&&` | logical AND |
| `\|\|` | logical OR |
| `!` | logical NOT |

\index{short-circuit evaluation}
Both `&&` and `||` use **short-circuit evaluation**, just like C++. With `&&`,
if the left side is false, the right side is never evaluated. With `||`, if the
left side is true, the right side is skipped:

```c
int *p = NULL;
if (p != NULL && *p > 0) {
    // safe — *p is only evaluated if p is not NULL
}
```

### No Built-in `bool`

\index{stdbool.h}
\index{bool}

In C++, `bool` is a built-in type. In C89, there is no boolean type at all — you
use `int` where `0` is false and anything nonzero is true. C99 added `_Bool` as
a keyword and `<stdbool.h>` as a convenience header that defines `bool`, `true`,
and `false`:

```c
#include <stdbool.h>

bool is_valid = true;
if (is_valid) {
    printf("All aboard the Crazy Train!\n");
}
```

Without `<stdbool.h>`, you will see code like this:

```c
int done = 0;    // 0 means false
while (!done) {
    // ... do work ...
    done = 1;    // nonzero means true
}
```

::: {.tip}
**Tip:** In C, any nonzero value is true. The number `42`, the character `'A'`,
and the pointer `0x7fff` are all true. Only `0` (and `NULL` for pointers) is
false. This is why you can write `if (ptr)` instead of `if (ptr != NULL)` — they
mean the same thing.
:::

## Bitwise Operators

\index{bitwise operators}

Bitwise operators work on the individual bits of integer values. In C++, `<<`
and `>>` are commonly used for stream I/O. In C, they are exclusively bit shift
operators.

| Operator | Operation | Example | Result |
|:---:|:---|:---|:---|
| `&` | bitwise AND | `0xF0 & 0x3C` | `0x30` |
| `\|` | bitwise OR | `0xF0 \| 0x0F` | `0xFF` |
| `^` | bitwise XOR | `0xFF ^ 0x0F` | `0xF0` |
| `~` | bitwise NOT | `~0x00` | `0xFF...FF` |
| `<<` | left shift | `1 << 3` | `8` |
| `>>` | right shift | `16 >> 2` | `4` |

### Flag Manipulation

\index{bitwise operators!flags}

One of the most common uses of bitwise operators in C is manipulating **flags**
— individual bits within an integer that each represent an on/off setting:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

#define FLAG_READ    (1 << 0)   // bit 0: 0x01
#define FLAG_WRITE   (1 << 1)   // bit 1: 0x02
#define FLAG_EXEC    (1 << 2)   // bit 2: 0x04

int main(void) {
    unsigned int perms = 0;

    // Set bits with |
    perms |= FLAG_READ;
    perms |= FLAG_WRITE;
    printf("perms = 0x%02X\n", perms);   // 0x03

    // Check a bit with &
    if (perms & FLAG_READ) {
        printf("Read permission is set\n");
    }
    if (!(perms & FLAG_EXEC)) {
        printf("Execute permission is NOT set\n");
    }

    // Toggle a bit with ^
    perms ^= FLAG_WRITE;
    printf("After toggling write: 0x%02X\n", perms);   // 0x01

    // Clear a bit with & and ~
    perms &= ~FLAG_READ;
    printf("After clearing read: 0x%02X\n", perms);    // 0x00

    return 0;
}
```

The pattern is straightforward:

- **Set** a bit: `flags |= BIT;`
- **Clear** a bit: `flags &= ~BIT;`
- **Toggle** a bit: `flags ^= BIT;`
- **Check** a bit: `if (flags & BIT)`

::: {.tip}
**Tip:** Shifting `1` to create bit masks — `(1 << n)` — is a common idiom in
C for hardware registers, permission flags, and option bitmasks. It is clearer
than writing raw hex values because you can see exactly which bit position you
are targeting.
:::

## Compound Assignment Operators

\index{compound assignment}

Compound assignment operators combine an arithmetic or bitwise operation with
assignment. They work exactly as in C++:

| Operator | Equivalent to |
|:---:|:---|
| `a += b` | `a = a + b` |
| `a -= b` | `a = a - b` |
| `a *= b` | `a = a * b` |
| `a /= b` | `a = a / b` |
| `a %= b` | `a = a % b` |
| `a &= b` | `a = a & b` |
| `a \|= b` | `a = a \| b` |
| `a ^= b` | `a = a ^ b` |
| `a <<= b` | `a = a << b` |
| `a >>= b` | `a = a >> b` |

These are not just shortcuts — they express intent more clearly. When you write
`count += 1`, the reader knows you are incrementing `count`. When you write
`count = count + 1`, the reader has to verify that the same variable appears on
both sides.

## Increment and Decrement

\index{increment operator}
\index{decrement operator}

The `++` and `--` operators increment or decrement a variable by one. They come
in prefix and postfix forms:

```c
int x = 5;
int a = ++x;   // prefix: x becomes 6, then a gets 6
int b = x++;   // postfix: b gets 6 (current value), then x becomes 7
```

In a standalone statement, `x++` and `++x` do the same thing — increment `x`.
The difference only matters when the result is used in a larger expression.

::: {.tip}
**Trap:** Do not modify a variable more than once in the same expression. The
result is **undefined behavior**:

```c
int i = 3;
int result = i++ + ++i;   // UNDEFINED BEHAVIOR — do not do this
```

The compiler is free to evaluate the sub-expressions in any order, and different
compilers (or even the same compiler with different optimization levels) may
produce different results. If you need multiple modifications, use separate
statements.
:::

## The Ternary Operator

\index{ternary operator}

The ternary operator `? :` is a compact alternative to `if`/`else` for simple
value selection:

```c
int volume = 11;
const char *verdict = (volume > 10) ? "Loco" : "Tranquilo";
printf("Volume %d: %s\n", volume, verdict);   // Volume 11: Loco
```

The syntax is `condition ? value_if_true : value_if_false`. The ternary operator
is an expression, so it produces a value that can be used in assignments,
function arguments, or anywhere a value is expected:

```c
printf("Track %d is %s\n", track,
       (track % 2 == 0) ? "even" : "odd");
```

::: {.tip}
**Tip:** The ternary operator is great for simple one-line decisions. If your
condition or either branch is complex, use a regular `if`/`else` instead.
Readability matters more than cleverness.
:::

## Operator Precedence

\index{operator precedence}

When multiple operators appear in an expression, C evaluates them according to a
precedence table. Here are the most important levels, from highest (evaluated
first) to lowest:

| Precedence | Operators | Description |
|:---:|:---|:---|
| 1 | `()` `[]` `->` `.` | grouping, subscript, member access |
| 2 | `!` `~` `++` `--` `+` `-` `*` `&` `(type)` `sizeof` | unary operators |
| 3 | `*` `/` `%` | multiplication, division, remainder |
| 4 | `+` `-` | addition, subtraction |
| 5 | `<<` `>>` | bitwise shifts |
| 6 | `<` `<=` `>` `>=` | relational |
| 7 | `==` `!=` | equality |
| 8 | `&` | bitwise AND |
| 9 | `^` | bitwise XOR |
| 10 | `\|` | bitwise OR |
| 11 | `&&` | logical AND |
| 12 | `\|\|` | logical OR |
| 13 | `? :` | ternary |
| 14 | `=` `+=` `-=` etc. | assignment |
| 15 | `,` | comma |

### Common Precedence Traps

\index{operator precedence!traps}

The most dangerous precedence surprise is that **bitwise operators bind more
loosely than comparison operators**:

```c
// WRONG — this checks (x) & (0x04 == 0x04), which is (x) & (1)
if (x & 0x04 == 0x04) { ... }

// RIGHT — parentheses fix the precedence
if ((x & 0x04) == 0x04) { ... }
```

Similarly, `||` has lower precedence than `&&`, which matches mathematical
convention (AND before OR) but can surprise you:

```c
// This evaluates as: a || (b && c)  — not (a || b) && c
if (a || b && c) { ... }
```

::: {.tip}
**Tip:** When in doubt, use parentheses. No one will fault you for writing
`(a & b) == c` instead of relying on precedence rules. The few extra characters
make your intent unmistakable and save the next reader (who might be you)
from having to look up the precedence table.
:::

## Try It: Expressions Starter

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    // Assignment chaining
    int a, b, c;
    a = b = c = 1980;
    printf("a=%d b=%d c=%d\n", a, b, c);

    // Integer division and remainder
    printf("17 / 5 = %d\n", 17 / 5);
    printf("17 %% 5 = %d\n", 17 % 5);
    printf("-17 %% 5 = %d\n", -17 % 5);

    // Boolean values are just ints
    printf("(10 > 5) = %d\n", 10 > 5);
    printf("(10 < 5) = %d\n", 10 < 5);

    // Bitwise flag manipulation
    unsigned int flags = 0;
    flags |= (1 << 0);   // set bit 0
    flags |= (1 << 2);   // set bit 2
    printf("flags = 0x%02X\n", flags);        // 0x05
    printf("bit 1 set? %d\n", (flags & (1 << 1)) != 0);  // 0
    printf("bit 2 set? %d\n", (flags & (1 << 2)) != 0);  // 1

    // Ternary operator
    int vol = 11;
    printf("Volume: %s\n", (vol > 10) ? "Muy alto" : "Normal");

    // Compound assignment
    int total = 100;
    total += 50;
    total -= 20;
    total *= 2;
    printf("total = %d\n", total);   // 260

    return 0;
}
```

## Key Points

- Assignment is an expression in C — it produces a value, enabling chaining
  (`a = b = c = 0`) and assignment within conditions.
- Integer division truncates toward zero. The `%` operator gives the remainder,
  which preserves the sign of the dividend.
- C uses `int` for boolean results: `0` is false, nonzero is true. Include
  `<stdbool.h>` for `bool`, `true`, and `false`.
- Bitwise `<<` and `>>` are shifts only — they are not overloaded for I/O as
  in C++.
- Use `|` to set bits, `&` to check bits, `^` to toggle bits, and `& ~` to
  clear bits.
- Bitwise operators have lower precedence than comparison operators. Always use
  parentheses when mixing them.
- Never modify a variable more than once in the same expression — the result is
  undefined behavior.

## Exercises

1. **Think about it:** In C++, you can overload operators to give `+`, `<<`,
   `==`, and others custom meanings for your classes. C does not allow operator
   overloading. What advantage does this give you when reading unfamiliar C
   code? Can you think of a situation where operator overloading would have been
   genuinely useful in C?

2. **What does this print?**

    ```c
    int x = 10;
    int y = x++ + ++x;
    printf("%d %d\n", x, y);
    ```

    (Be careful — is the answer even defined?)

3. **Calculation:** What is the result of each of these expressions?

    ```c
    25 / 4
    25 % 4
    -25 % 4
    (1 << 4) | (1 << 1)
    0xFF & 0x0F
    ```

4. **Where is the bug?**

    ```c
    int status = 0x07;
    if (status & 0x04 == 0x04) {
        printf("Bit 2 is set\n");
    }
    ```

5. **What does this print?**

    ```c
    int a = 5, b = 10;
    a ^= b;
    b ^= a;
    a ^= b;
    printf("a=%d b=%d\n", a, b);
    ```

6. **Where is the bug?**

    ```c
    int count = 0;
    if (count = 0) {
        printf("El contador es cero\n");
    } else {
        printf("El contador no es cero\n");
    }
    ```

7. **Write a program** that takes an `unsigned int` and prints its value in
   binary (most significant bit first). Use bitwise operators to test each bit.
   Test it with the values `0`, `1`, `255`, and `1024`.

\newpage

# 4. Control Flow

Control flow in C will feel very familiar if you are coming from C++. The `if`,
`while`, `for`, and `switch` statements work essentially the same way. The
differences are small but worth knowing: C has no range-based `for` loops, no
structured bindings, and no `std::optional`. In C89, all variable declarations
had to appear at the top of a block before any statements — C99 relaxed this
and let you declare variables anywhere, which is how you are used to writing
code in C++.

The biggest conceptual difference is that C has no native `bool` type.
Conditions are just integers: zero is false, and any nonzero value is true.

## `if` / `else`

\index{if statement}

The `if` statement in C is identical to C++:

```c
int score = 85;

if (score >= 90) {
    printf("Excelente!\n");
} else if (score >= 70) {
    printf("Passing\n");
} else {
    printf("Try again\n");
}
```

The condition in an `if` is an integer expression. Zero means false, nonzero
means true. There is no built-in `bool` type in C89. C99 added `_Bool` and
the convenience header `<stdbool.h>`, which defines `bool`, `true`, and
`false`:

```c
#include <stdbool.h>

bool is_hurricane = true;
if (is_hurricane) {
    printf("Here I am\n");
}
```

\index{stdbool.h}

Without `<stdbool.h>`, C programmers traditionally use `int` for boolean values
and `0`/`1` for false/true, or define their own macros.

::: {.tip}
**Trap:** Because conditions are just integers, assignments inside `if` are
legal and a common source of bugs:

```c
int x = 0;
if (x = 5) {            // BUG: assigns 5 to x, then tests 5 (nonzero = true)
    printf("oops\n");    // always prints
}
```

The compiler may warn you about this, but it will not stop you. If you mean
to compare, use `==`. Compiling with `-Wall` helps catch these.
:::

## `while` and `do-while`

\index{while loop}
\index{do-while loop}

A `while` loop tests the condition *before* executing the body. If the
condition is false from the start, the body never executes:

```c
int countdown = 5;
while (countdown > 0) {
    printf("%d... ", countdown);
    countdown--;
}
printf("Vamos!\n");
// 5... 4... 3... 2... 1... Vamos!
```

A `do-while` loop tests *after* the body, guaranteeing at least one iteration.
This is useful when you need to perform an action before you can check whether
to continue:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    int choice;
    do {
        printf("1) Rock  2) Paper  3) Scissors  0) Quit\n");
        printf("Enter choice: ");
        scanf("%d", &choice);
        printf("You picked %d\n", choice);
    } while (choice != 0);

    printf("Adios!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

The semicolon after `while (choice != 0)` is required — forgetting it is a
syntax error.

::: {.tip}
**Tip:** Use `do-while` when the loop body must execute at least once. Menu
loops and input validation loops are classic use cases. If you find yourself
duplicating code before a `while` loop just to set up the first test, a
`do-while` is probably cleaner.
:::

## `break` and `continue`

\index{break}
\index{continue}

`break` exits the nearest enclosing loop (or `switch`) immediately. `continue`
skips the rest of the current iteration and jumps to the next one.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    /* break example: stop at the first multiple of 7 */
    for (int i = 1; i <= 20; i++) {
        if (i % 7 == 0) {
            printf("Found it: %d\n", i);
            break;
        }
    }

    /* continue example: skip odd numbers */
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        if (i % 2 != 0)
            continue;
        printf("%d ", i);
    }
    printf("\n");
    // 0 2 4 6 8

    return 0;
}
```

`break` and `continue` only affect the innermost loop. If you have nested
loops and need to break out of an outer loop, you either use a flag variable
or, in some cases, `goto` (discussed later in this chapter).

## `for` Loops

\index{for loop}

The `for` loop has the same structure as in C++:

```c
for (init; condition; update) {
    /* body */
}
```

Here is a classic example iterating over an array:

```c
int scores[] = {90, 84, 77, 95, 88};
int n = sizeof(scores) / sizeof(scores[0]);

for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    printf("Score %d: %d\n", i + 1, scores[i]);
}
```

\index{for loop!C89 vs C99}
C99 allows you to declare the loop variable inside the `for` statement, just
like modern C++. In C89, you had to declare it before the loop:

```c
/* C89 style */
int i;
for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    printf("%d\n", scores[i]);
}

/* C99 style — preferred */
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    printf("%d\n", scores[i]);
}
```

::: {.tip}
**Tip:** C has no range-based `for` loop. There is no `for (auto x : vec)`.
You always iterate with an index or a pointer. The `sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0])`
idiom gives you the element count of a stack-allocated array, but it does not
work on pointers — a pointer does not carry size information. This is why C
functions that take arrays almost always take a separate `size` parameter.
:::

You can iterate over an array with a pointer instead of an index. This is
idiomatic C and worth getting comfortable with:

```c
int nums[] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
int *end = nums + sizeof(nums) / sizeof(nums[0]);

for (int *p = nums; p < end; p++) {
    printf("%d ", *p);
}
printf("\n");
// 10 20 30 40 50
```

Any part of the `for` header can be omitted. Omitting all three creates an
infinite loop:

```c
for (;;) {
    /* runs forever — use break to exit */
}
```

## `switch` Statements

\index{switch statement}

A `switch` statement selects among multiple cases based on an integer
expression. If you have used `switch` in C++, the syntax is identical:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    int wind = 5;   /* Beaufort scale */

    switch (wind) {
    case 0:
        printf("Calm\n");
        break;
    case 5:
        printf("Fresh breeze\n");
        break;
    case 12:
        printf("Huracan!\n");
        break;
    default:
        printf("Wind level: %d\n", wind);
        break;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Each `case` must be an integer constant expression. You cannot use strings,
floats, or variables as case labels — only values the compiler can evaluate at
compile time.

\index{switch statement!fall-through}
**Fall-through** is the most important thing to understand about `switch` in C.
If you forget a `break`, execution falls through to the next case. This is
sometimes intentional:

```c
char grade = 'B';

switch (grade) {
case 'A':
case 'B':
case 'C':
    printf("Passing\n");
    break;
case 'D':
case 'F':
    printf("Not passing\n");
    break;
default:
    printf("Invalid grade\n");
    break;
}
```

Here, cases `'A'`, `'B'`, and `'C'` all fall through to the same `printf`.
This is deliberate and a common pattern. But accidental fall-through is a
frequent bug:

```c
switch (x) {
case 1:
    printf("one\n");
    /* oops, forgot break — falls into case 2 */
case 2:
    printf("two\n");
    break;
}
```

If `x` is `1`, this prints both "one" and "two."

::: {.tip}
**Trap:** Every `case` should end with `break` unless you intentionally want
fall-through. When you do use fall-through on purpose, add a comment like
`/* fall through */` so the next person reading the code knows it is
deliberate. Some compilers recognize this comment and suppress warnings.
:::

## `goto`

\index{goto}

In C++, you were probably taught to never use `goto`. In C, `goto` has a
legitimate and widely used role: the **cleanup pattern**. When a function
acquires multiple resources (files, memory, locks), and something goes wrong
partway through, `goto` provides a clean way to release everything in the
correct order.

Here is a brief example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int process(const char *path) {
    int status = -1;

    FILE *f = fopen(path, "r");
    if (!f) return -1;

    char *buf = malloc(1024);
    if (!buf) goto close_file;

    /* ... do work with f and buf ... */
    status = 0;

    free(buf);
close_file:
    fclose(f);
    return status;
}
```

If `malloc` fails, control jumps to `close_file`, which closes the file that
was already opened. Without `goto`, you would need deeply nested `if`
statements or duplicated cleanup code. The `goto` cleanup pattern is used
extensively in production C code, including the Linux kernel.

::: {.tip}
**Tip:** The `goto` cleanup pattern is covered in more detail in the Odds and
Ends chapter. For now, just know that `goto` in C is not the taboo it is in
C++. When used strictly for forward jumps to cleanup labels at the end of a
function, it makes resource management clearer, not messier.
:::

`goto` has two restrictions: you can only jump within the same function, and
you cannot jump over a variable declaration that has an initializer (in C99+).

## Try It: Control Flow Starter

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    /* if / else */
    int wind = 74;   /* mph */
    if (wind >= 74) {
        printf("Rock you like a hurricane!\n");
    } else if (wind >= 39) {
        printf("Tropical storm\n");
    } else {
        printf("Calm seas\n");
    }

    /* while */
    int n = 1;
    while (n <= 5) {
        printf("%d ", n);
        n++;
    }
    printf("\n");

    /* do-while: repeat until valid input */
    int guess;
    do {
        printf("Guess (1-10): ");
        scanf("%d", &guess);
    } while (guess < 1 || guess > 10);
    printf("You guessed %d\n", guess);

    /* for with break and continue */
    printf("Even numbers up to 20: ");
    for (int i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
        if (i > 20)
            break;
        if (i % 2 != 0)
            continue;
        printf("%d ", i);
    }
    printf("\n");

    /* switch */
    int track = 3;
    printf("Side B, Track %d: ", track);
    switch (track) {
    case 1:  printf("Big City Nights\n");   break;
    case 2:  printf("Winds of Change\n"); break;
    case 3:  printf("Rock You Like a Hurricane\n"); break;
    default: printf("Unknown track\n");     break;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

## Key Points

- C's control flow statements (`if`, `while`, `do-while`, `for`, `switch`)
  are syntactically identical to C++.
- C uses integers for boolean conditions: 0 is false, nonzero is true.
  Include `<stdbool.h>` for `bool`, `true`, and `false` (C99+).
- `break` exits the nearest loop or `switch`. `continue` skips to the next
  iteration.
- C has no range-based `for` loop. Use index or pointer iteration.
- `switch` cases must be integer constants. Watch for accidental fall-through.
- `goto` is legitimate in C for the cleanup pattern — forward jumps to
  release resources in reverse order.

## Exercises

1. **Think about it:** C uses `0` for false and nonzero for true, while C++
   has a built-in `bool` type. What practical problems can arise from using
   integers as booleans? Can you think of a case where a nonzero value that
   is not `1` might cause a subtle bug?

2. **What does this print?**

    ```c
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        if (i == 3)
            continue;
        printf("%d ", i);
    }
    printf("\n");
    ```

3. **What does this print?**

    ```c
    int x = 2;
    switch (x) {
    case 1:
        printf("uno ");
    case 2:
        printf("dos ");
    case 3:
        printf("tres ");
        break;
    default:
        printf("other ");
    }
    printf("\n");
    ```

4. **Where is the bug?**

    ```c
    int total = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++);
    {
        total += i;
    }
    printf("Total: %d\n", total);
    ```

5. **Calculation:** How many times does the body of this loop execute?

    ```c
    int count = 0;
    int i = 10;
    do {
        count++;
        i--;
    } while (i > 10);
    ```

6. **Where is the bug?**

    ```c
    int level = 5;
    if (level = 10) {
        printf("Max level!\n");
    }
    ```

7. **Write a program** that reads integers from the user (using `scanf`) until
   the user enters `0`. Print the sum and average of all numbers entered
   (not counting the `0`). Use a `do-while` or `while` loop.

# 5. Pointers

If you have been writing modern C++, you may have rarely (or never) used raw
pointers. Smart pointers like `std::unique_ptr` and `std::shared_ptr` manage
memory for you. References let you pass objects without copying them. The
standard library hides pointer details behind iterators and containers.

In C, none of that exists. Pointers are everywhere, and you must be comfortable
with them. Every dynamic data structure, every function that needs to modify its
arguments, every interaction with the operating system — all involve pointers.

## What Is a Pointer?

\index{pointer}

A pointer is a variable that holds a memory address. That's it. Instead of
holding a value like `42`, a pointer holds the *location* where `42` is stored.

## Declaring Pointers

A pointer type is declared by placing a `*` after the base type. The type before
the `*` tells you what kind of data lives at the address the pointer holds:

```c
int *p;         // p is a pointer to an int
char *s;        // s is a pointer to a char
double *d;      // d is a pointer to a double
```

::: {.tip}
**Trap:** The `*` belongs to the variable, not the type. This declaration creates
one pointer and one regular int:

```c
int *p, q;    // p is a pointer to int; q is just an int
```

To declare two pointers, you need two stars: `int *p, *q;`
:::

## The Address-Of Operator: `&`

\index{address-of operator (\&)}

The `&` operator returns the address of a variable. You have seen `&` in C++ for
references — in C, it is strictly the address-of operator:

```c
int score = 100;
int *p = &score;   // p now holds the address of score

printf("score = %d\n", score);    // 100
printf("address of score = %p\n", (void *)p);  // something like 0x7ffd5e8a3b2c
```

## Dereferencing: `*`

\index{dereference operator (*)}

The `*` operator on a pointer gives you the value at the address the pointer
holds. This is called **dereferencing**:

```c
int score = 100;
int *p = &score;

printf("Value at p: %d\n", *p);   // 100

*p = 200;                          // modify score through the pointer
printf("score is now: %d\n", score);  // 200
```

Notice the dual use of `*`: in a declaration, it means "this is a pointer." In
an expression, it means "follow the pointer to the value."

## Pointers to Pointers

\index{pointer!to pointer}

Since a pointer is just a variable, it has an address too. You can create a
pointer to a pointer:

```c
int val = 42;
int *p = &val;       // p points to val
int **pp = &p;       // pp points to p

printf("val = %d\n", val);       // 42
printf("*p = %d\n", *p);        // 42
printf("**pp = %d\n", **pp);    // 42
```

You dereference `pp` twice: once to get `p`, and again to get `val`. Pointers to
pointers show up frequently in C — for example, `main` can be declared as
`int main(int argc, char **argv)`, where `argv` is a pointer to an array of
string pointers.

## Visualizing Pointers in Memory

Consider this small program:

```c
int x = 1985;
int y = 80;
int *p = &x;
int **pp = &p;
```

Every variable lives at some address in memory. Here is what the layout looks
like (using made-up but realistic addresses):

```
  Variable    Address      Value
  --------    ----------   ----------
  x           0x1000       1985
  y           0x1004       80
  p           0x1008       0x1000  -------> x
  pp          0x1010       0x1008  -------> p -------> x
```

The variable `x` lives at address `0x1000` and holds the value `1985`. The
pointer `p` lives at address `0x1008` and holds the value `0x1000` — the address
of `x`. The pointer-to-pointer `pp` lives at `0x1010` and holds `0x1008` — the
address of `p`. Following the chain: `*pp` gives you `p` (which is `0x1000`),
and `**pp` gives you `x` (which is `1985`).

Notice that `p` and `pp` are just variables that hold numbers. Those numbers
happen to be memory addresses. There is nothing magical about a pointer — it is
just a variable whose value is an address.

::: {.tip}
**Tip:** You can take the address of any variable with `&`, including the
address of a pointer variable. The expression `&p` gives you the address where
`p` itself is stored, not the address `p` points to.
:::

## NULL Pointers

\index{NULL}

A pointer that does not point to anything should be set to `NULL`:

```c
int *p = NULL;   // p points to nothing

if (p != NULL) {
    printf("Value: %d\n", *p);
} else {
    printf("Pointer is NULL\n");
}
```

Dereferencing a `NULL` pointer is undefined behavior and usually crashes your
program with a segmentation fault. Always check before dereferencing a pointer
you did not initialize yourself.

::: {.tip}
**Tip:** In C, `NULL` is typically defined as `((void *)0)`. You may also see
`0` used directly. C++11 introduced `nullptr` as a type-safe null pointer — C
does not have `nullptr`, so use `NULL`.
:::

## Pointers and Arrays

A pointer might point to a single value in memory, or it might point to the
first element of an array of values. There is nothing in the type system that
tells you which — an `int *` looks the same either way:

```c
int score = 100;
int *p = &score;              // points to one int

int nums[] = {10, 20, 30};
int *q = nums;                // points to the first of three ints
```

Both `p` and `q` are `int *`. The compiler does not know whether there are more
`int` values after the one being pointed to. It is up to you, the programmer, to
keep track of how many elements a pointer refers to and to stay within bounds.

You already saw in the Variables chapter that an array name decays to a pointer
to its first element. Now let's see what that lets you do.

\index{pointer!arithmetic}
**Pointer arithmetic** works in units of the pointed-to type. If `p` is an
`int *` and `int` is 4 bytes, then `p + 1` advances the address by 4 bytes to
the next `int`. You never have to think about byte sizes — the compiler handles
it:

```c
int nums[] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
int *p = nums;

printf("%d\n", *p);       // 10 (same as nums[0])
printf("%d\n", *(p + 1)); // 20 (same as nums[1])
printf("%d\n", p[2]);     // 30 — yes, you can use [] on pointers!
```

::: {.tip}
**Tip:** Array indexing `nums[i]` is actually syntactic sugar for `*(nums + i)`.
This is why `2[nums]` technically works — it is `*(2 + nums)`, which is the same
thing. Don't write code like that, but knowing this helps you understand how
arrays and pointers relate.
:::

## Pointers and Structures

You already know how to declare structs and access members with `.` from the
Variables chapter. Pointers to structures are extremely common in C — almost any
non-trivial program passes struct pointers around rather than copying entire
structs.

```c
struct song {
    char title[40];
    int year;
};

struct song track = {"Karma Chameleon", 1983};
struct song *p = &track;
```

To access a field through a pointer, you must dereference the pointer first.
But the `.` operator has higher precedence than `*`, so you need parentheses:

```c
printf("Title: %s\n", (*p).title);   // parentheses required
printf("Year: %d\n", (*p).year);
```

\index{arrow operator (->)}
Writing `(*p).field` everywhere is tedious. C provides the `->` operator as a
convenient shorthand:

```c
printf("Title: %s\n", p->title);     // same as (*p).title
printf("Year: %d\n", p->year);       // same as (*p).year
```

::: {.tip}
**Tip:** The `->` operator is simply `(*p).field` written more clearly. You
will see `->` far more often than `(*p).` in real C code. If you have a
pointer to a struct, reach for `->`.
:::

## Pass by Value (and Pointers as a Workaround)

\index{pass by value}

In C++, you can pass arguments by reference using `&`:

```cpp
void increment(int &x) { x++; }   // C++ — modifies the original
```

C does not have references. **All function parameters in C are pass by value** —
the function receives a copy of the argument, not the original. If you want a
function to modify a variable in the caller, you pass a *pointer* to it:

```c
void increment(int *x) {
    (*x)++;   // dereference the pointer, then increment
}

int main(void) {
    int score = 99;
    increment(&score);      // pass the ADDRESS of score
    printf("%d\n", score);  // 100
    return 0;
}
```

The function `increment` receives a *copy* of the pointer (the address), but
since both the original and the copy point to the same memory, dereferencing
either one reaches the same variable. This is how C simulates pass by reference.

::: {.tip}
**Tip:** Every time you see a function parameter with `*` in C, ask yourself:
"Is this pointer here so the function can modify the caller's variable, or
because it needs to access a block of memory (like an array)?" Often it is
both.
:::

## Try It: Pointer Starter

This program demonstrates the core pointer operations:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void swap(int *a, int *b) {
    int temp = *a;
    *a = *b;
    *b = temp;
}

int main(void) {
    // Basic pointer usage
    int val = 1985;
    int *p = &val;
    printf("val = %d, *p = %d\n", val, *p);
    printf("Address of val: %p\n", (void *)&val);

    // Modify through pointer
    *p = 1989;
    printf("After *p = 1989: val = %d\n", val);

    // Pointer to pointer
    int **pp = &p;
    printf("**pp = %d\n", **pp);

    // Pass by value with pointers
    int x = 10, y = 20;
    printf("Before swap: x=%d, y=%d\n", x, y);
    swap(&x, &y);
    printf("After swap:  x=%d, y=%d\n", x, y);

    // Arrays and pointers
    char *words[] = {"Totally", "Radical", "Tubular"};
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        printf("words[%d] = %s\n", i, words[i]);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

## Key Points

- A pointer holds a memory address. Use `&` to get an address and `*` to
  dereference it.
- All pointers are the same size on a given system, regardless of the type they
  point to.
- Arrays decay to pointers in most expressions. `a[i]` is equivalent to
  `*(a + i)`.
- Pointer arithmetic moves in units of the pointed-to type, not bytes.
- Use `->` to access struct fields through a pointer. It is shorthand for
  `(*p).field`.
- All function parameters in C are pass by value. Pass a pointer to modify the
  caller's variable.

## Exercises

1. **Think about it:** In C++, you can pass by reference to modify a caller's
   variable. Why do you think C was designed with only pass by value? What does
   this simplify in the language?

2. **What does this print?**

    ```c
    int a[] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
    int *p = a + 2;
    printf("%d %d %d\n", *p, *(p - 1), p[1]);
    ```

3. **Calculation:** On a 64-bit system, what is `sizeof(int *)`,
   `sizeof(char *)`, and `sizeof(double *)`?

4. **Where is the bug?**

    ```c
    int *get_value(void) {
        int result = 42;
        return &result;
    }
    ```

5. **What does this print?**

    ```c
    int x = 10;
    int *p = &x;
    int **pp = &p;
    **pp = 20;
    printf("%d\n", x);
    ```

6. **Where is the bug?**

    ```c
    struct song {
        char title[40];
        int year;
    };

    struct song *p = NULL;
    printf("%s\n", p->title);
    ```

7. **Write a program** that declares an array of 5 integers, uses a pointer to
   iterate through the array, and prints each element along with its memory
   address.

# 6. Functions

C functions look a lot like C++ functions — same return types, same curly braces,
same `return` statement. But several features you rely on in C++ are simply not
available in C. There is no function overloading, no default arguments, no
references, and no `auto` return type deduction. Every parameter is pass by
value. If you want a function to modify a caller's variable, you pass a pointer.

Despite these restrictions, C functions are straightforward. Once you understand
the handful of differences from C++, you will find them easy to work with.

## Function Declarations and Definitions

\index{function!declaration}
\index{function!definition}
\index{prototype}

In C++, you can often define a function before it is called and skip the
separate declaration. In C, you should always declare a function (provide its
**prototype**) before you call it. A prototype tells the compiler the function's
return type, name, and parameter types — without the body:

```c
int add(int a, int b);        // declaration (prototype)
```

The **definition** provides the body:

```c
int add(int a, int b) {       // definition
    return a + b;
}
```

Prototypes typically go in header files (`.h`) so that other `.c` files can call
the function. The definition lives in exactly one `.c` file.

::: {.tip}
**Tip:** In C++, `int foo()` means "takes no parameters." In C, `int foo()`
means "takes an *unspecified* number of parameters" — the compiler will not
check your arguments at all. To declare a function that truly takes no
parameters in C, write `int foo(void)`. Always use `void` in empty parameter
lists.
:::

\index{void parameter list}

Here is the difference in action:

```c
int get_score(void);    // takes no parameters — compiler enforces this
int get_score();        // unspecified parameters — compiler won't check
```

You will see `int main(void)` throughout this book for exactly this reason.

### No Overloading

\index{function!overloading}

In C++, you can have multiple functions with the same name but different
parameter types:

```cpp
int max(int a, int b);
double max(double a, double b);   // C++ overload — fine
```

C does not support this. Every function must have a unique name. If you need a
`max` for both `int` and `double`, you name them differently:

```c
int max_int(int a, int b);
double max_double(double a, double b);
```

### No Default Arguments

\index{function!default arguments}

C++ lets you provide default values for parameters:

```cpp
void greet(const char *name, int times = 1);   // C++ — valid
```

C does not support default arguments. Every argument must be provided at every
call site:

```c
void greet(const char *name, int times);   // C — no defaults allowed

greet("Iron Man", 3);   // must pass both arguments
```

## Pass by Value

As you saw in the Pointers chapter, all function parameters in C are pass by
value — the function receives a copy of each argument. To modify a caller's
variable, pass a pointer. There are no `&` reference parameters in C; every
"output" parameter is a pointer.

## `const` Parameters

\index{const!parameter}

When a function takes a pointer parameter, the caller cannot tell from the
call site whether the function will modify the data. The `const` keyword solves
this by making a promise: "I will not modify what this pointer points to."

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void print_name(const char *name) {
    printf("I am %s\n", name);
    // name[0] = 'X';   // ERROR — name points to const data
}

int main(void) {
    print_name("Iron Man");
    return 0;
}
```

\index{const!documentation}

Using `const` serves two purposes. First, it documents intent — anyone reading
the prototype knows the function will not modify the data. Second, it catches
bugs at compile time. If you accidentally try to write through a `const`
pointer, the compiler will stop you.

::: {.tip}
**Tip:** Make every pointer parameter `const` unless the function genuinely
needs to modify the pointed-to data. This is one of the cheapest and most
effective ways to prevent bugs in C.
:::

You will see `const char *` everywhere in C — it is the standard way to accept
a string that the function will read but not modify. Functions like `printf`,
`strlen`, and `strcmp` all take `const char *` parameters.

## Passing Structures

\index{struct!passing}

Structures can be passed by value just like any other type. The function
receives a complete copy of the struct:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

struct hero {
    char name[40];
    int power;
};

void print_hero(struct hero h) {
    printf("%s (power: %d)\n", h.name, h.power);
}

int main(void) {
    struct hero tony = {"Iron Man", 100};
    print_hero(tony);   // passes a COPY of tony
    return 0;
}
```

This works, but copying a large struct every time you call a function is
wasteful. If `struct hero` had thousands of bytes of data, every call to
`print_hero` would copy all of it onto the stack.

The solution is to pass a pointer to the struct instead. Since the function only
needs to read the data, use `const`:

```c
void print_hero(const struct hero *h) {
    printf("%s (power: %d)\n", h->name, h->power);
}

int main(void) {
    struct hero tony = {"Iron Man", 100};
    print_hero(&tony);   // passes only an 8-byte pointer
    return 0;
}
```

::: {.tip}
**Tip:** For small structs (a few bytes), passing by value is fine and
sometimes clearer. For anything larger, prefer `const struct type *param`.
When the function needs to modify the struct, drop the `const`.
:::

If the function needs to modify the struct, you pass a non-`const` pointer:

```c
void level_up(struct hero *h) {
    h->power += 10;
}
```

This pattern — `const` pointer for read-only access, non-`const` pointer for
modification — is the C equivalent of const references and non-const references
in C++.

## Recursive Functions

\index{recursion}

C supports recursion just like C++. A function can call itself, and each call
gets its own set of local variables on the stack.

### Factorial

```c
#include <stdio.h>

long factorial(int n) {
    if (n <= 1)
        return 1;
    return n * factorial(n - 1);
}

int main(void) {
    printf("5! = %ld\n", factorial(5));    // 5! = 120
    printf("10! = %ld\n", factorial(10));  // 10! = 3628800
    return 0;
}
```

### Fibonacci

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int fibonacci(int n) {
    if (n <= 0) return 0;
    if (n == 1) return 1;
    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
}

int main(void) {
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        printf("%d ", fibonacci(i));
    }
    printf("\n");
    // 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34
    return 0;
}
```

::: {.tip}
**Trap:** This Fibonacci implementation has exponential time complexity because
it recomputes the same values over and over. It works for small inputs, but
try `fibonacci(50)` and you will be waiting a long time. In practice, you
would use an iterative approach or memoization.
:::

### Stack Depth

\index{stack overflow}

Every function call pushes a new frame onto the call stack. Recursive functions
can exhaust the stack if the recursion goes too deep. There is no built-in
protection — C will not throw a `std::bad_alloc` or a stack overflow exception.
The program will simply crash (usually with a segmentation fault). Keep your
recursion depth reasonable, or convert deep recursion to iteration.

## Function Pointers

\index{function pointer}

In C++, you might use `std::function`, lambdas, or template parameters to pass
behavior around. C has none of those — but it does have **function pointers**.
A function pointer is a variable that holds the address of a function.

### Declaring Function Pointers

The syntax takes some getting used to. A pointer to a function that takes two
`int` parameters and returns an `int` looks like this:

```c
int (*fp)(int, int);
```

Read it from the inside out: `fp` is a pointer (`*fp`) to a function that takes
`(int, int)` and returns `int`.

::: {.tip}
**Wut:** The parentheses around `*fp` are critical. Without them, `int *fp(int,
int)` declares a *function* that returns an `int *` — a completely different
thing. The parentheses force `fp` to be a pointer first.
:::

### Using Function Pointers

You can assign a function's name to a function pointer (the function name
decays to a pointer, just like array names do) and then call the function
through the pointer:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int add(int a, int b) { return a + b; }
int multiply(int a, int b) { return a * b; }

int main(void) {
    int (*op)(int, int);

    op = add;
    printf("3 + 4 = %d\n", op(3, 4));       // 7

    op = multiply;
    printf("3 * 4 = %d\n", op(3, 4));       // 12

    return 0;
}
```

### Simplifying with `typedef`

\index{typedef!function pointer}

The raw function pointer syntax is noisy. A `typedef` gives it a clean name:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

typedef int (*binop_fn)(int, int);

int add(int a, int b) { return a + b; }
int subtract(int a, int b) { return a - b; }

void apply(binop_fn fn, int x, int y) {
    printf("result = %d\n", fn(x, y));
}

int main(void) {
    apply(add, 10, 3);        // result = 13
    apply(subtract, 10, 3);   // result = 7
    return 0;
}
```

Now `binop_fn` is a type that means "pointer to a function taking two `int`
parameters and returning `int`." You can use it for parameters, local
variables, struct members, and arrays of function pointers.

### Callbacks

\index{callback}

Function pointers are often used as **callbacks** — you pass a function pointer
to another function, which calls it at the right moment. This is the C
equivalent of passing a lambda or functor in C++. The Odds and Ends chapter
shows a practical example using `qsort`, the standard library's sorting
function that takes a comparison callback.

## Try It: Functions Starter

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// Prototype with const pointer parameter
void shout(const char *msg);

// Struct and a function that takes a const pointer to it
struct song {
    char title[50];
    int year;
};

void print_song(const struct song *s) {
    printf("\"%s\" (%d)\n", s->title, s->year);
}

// Recursive factorial
long factorial(int n) {
    if (n <= 1) return 1;
    return n * factorial(n - 1);
}

// Function pointer demo
int sumar(int a, int b) { return a + b; }
int restar(int a, int b) { return a - b; }

typedef int (*math_fn)(int, int);

void compute(math_fn fn, int x, int y) {
    printf("  result = %d\n", fn(x, y));
}

// shout definition
void shout(const char *msg) {
    printf(">>> %s <<<\n", msg);
}

int main(void) {
    // const parameter
    shout("I Am Iron Man");

    // Passing a struct by pointer
    struct song fav = {"Iron Man", 1970};
    print_song(&fav);

    // Recursion
    printf("7! = %ld\n", factorial(7));   // 5040

    // Function pointers
    printf("sumar:\n");
    compute(sumar, 8, 3);     // result = 11
    printf("restar:\n");
    compute(restar, 8, 3);    // result = 5

    return 0;
}
```

## Key Points

- C functions have no overloading, no default arguments, and no references.
  Every parameter is pass by value.
- Use `void` in empty parameter lists: `int foo(void)`. In C, `int foo()`
  means "unspecified parameters," not "no parameters."
- Use `const` on pointer parameters when the function does not modify the
  pointed-to data. It documents intent and catches bugs.
- For large structs, prefer `const struct type *param` over pass by value to
  avoid expensive copies.
- Function pointers let you store and pass functions as values — C's
  replacement for lambdas and `std::function`.
- Use `typedef` to make function pointer types readable.

## Exercises

1. **Think about it:** C does not have function overloading. How does the C
   standard library handle providing similar functionality for different types?
   Look at `abs` (for `int`) and `fabs` (for `double`) as examples. What
   naming convention do you see?

2. **What does this print?**

    ```c
    void mystery(int x) {
        x = x * 2;
        printf("inside: %d\n", x);
    }

    int main(void) {
        int val = 5;
        mystery(val);
        printf("outside: %d\n", val);
        return 0;
    }
    ```

3. **Where is the bug?**

    ```c
    int count_chars(const char *s) {
        int count;
        while (*s != '\0') {
            count++;
            s++;
        }
        return count;
    }
    ```

4. **Calculation:** Given the struct below, approximately how many bytes are
   copied each time `process_data` is called with pass by value? Assume `int`
   is 4 bytes.

    ```c
    struct data {
        int values[1000];
        int count;
    };

    void process_data(struct data d) { /* ... */ }
    ```

5. **What does this print?**

    ```c
    int apply(int (*fn)(int, int), int a, int b) {
        return fn(a, b);
    }

    int mul(int a, int b) { return a * b; }

    int main(void) {
        printf("%d\n", apply(mul, 6, 7));
        return 0;
    }
    ```

6. **Where is the bug?**

    ```c
    int get_length(void);
    int get_length() { return 42; }

    int main(void) {
        printf("%d\n", get_length(1, 2, 3));
        return 0;
    }
    ```

7. **Write a program** that defines a function `void transform(int *arr, int n,
   int (*fn)(int))` which applies the function `fn` to each element of `arr`,
   modifying the array in place. Test it with a function that doubles each
   element and another that negates each element.

\newpage

# 7. Allocating Memory

Every variable in your program lives somewhere in memory, but not all memory is
created equal. Understanding where variables live — and how long they last — is
essential for writing correct C programs.

## Global Variables

\index{global variable}

A **global variable** is declared outside of any function. It is created when the
program starts and exists until the program exits:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int high_score = 0;   // global — lives for the entire program

void update_score(int points) {
    if (points > high_score) {
        high_score = points;
    }
}

int main(void) {
    update_score(1000);
    update_score(500);
    printf("High score: %d\n", high_score);  // 1000
    return 0;
}
```

Global variables are visible to every function in the file. They are convenient
but can make programs harder to reason about, since any function can change them.

::: {.tip}
**Tip:** Use global variables sparingly. When every function can read and write
the same variable, bugs become harder to track down. Prefer passing data through
function parameters.
:::

## Local Variables

\index{local variable}

A **local variable** is declared inside a function (or block). It is created when
the function is called and destroyed when the function returns:

```c
void greet(void) {
    char message[] = "Hola, amigo";  // local — exists only during greet()
    printf("%s\n", message);
}
// message is gone once greet() returns
```

\index{stack}
Local variables live on the **stack** — a region of memory that grows and shrinks
automatically as functions are called and return. You do not need to free stack
memory; it is reclaimed automatically.

::: {.tip}
**Trap:** Never return a pointer to a local variable. The memory is freed when the
function returns, and the pointer becomes a **dangling pointer** — it points to
memory that no longer belongs to you:

```c
int *bad(void) {
    int x = 42;
    return &x;   // BUG: x is destroyed when bad() returns
}
```
:::

## Static Local Variables

\index{static}

A **static local variable** has the scope of a local variable but the lifetime
of a global. It is declared inside a function with the `static` keyword, created
once when the program starts, and retains its value between calls:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void count_calls(void) {
    static int count = 0;   // initialized once, persists between calls
    count++;
    printf("Called %d time(s)\n", count);
}

int main(void) {
    count_calls();   // Called 1 time(s)
    count_calls();   // Called 2 time(s)
    count_calls();   // Called 3 time(s)
    return 0;
}
```

Without `static`, `count` would be reset to 0 on every call. With `static`, it
lives in the data segment (like a global) but is only accessible inside
`count_calls`.

## Dynamic Allocation: `malloc` and `free`

\index{malloc}
\index{free}

```c
void *malloc(size_t size);
void free(void *ptr);
```

Sometimes you need memory that outlives the function that created it, or memory
whose size you do not know at compile time. For this, C provides `malloc` and
`free` from `<stdlib.h>`.

\index{heap}
`malloc` allocates a block of memory on the **heap** and returns a pointer to it.
The heap is a region of memory that persists until you explicitly release it:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(void) {
    int *nums = malloc(5 * sizeof(int));
    if (nums == NULL) {
        printf("Allocation failed!\n");
        return 1;
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        nums[i] = (i + 1) * 10;
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        printf("nums[%d] = %d\n", i, nums[i]);
    }

    free(nums);   // release the memory back to the system
    return 0;
}
```

`malloc` returns a `void *` — a generic pointer that can be assigned to any
pointer type without a cast in C. It returns `NULL` if the allocation fails.
Always check for `NULL` after calling `malloc`.
Having said that, there is a school of thought held by some very good engineers that `NULL` checks just clutter the code.
To handle `NULL` gracefully, there will be a check and logic every place where it could be `NULL`, so you end up with checks and logic that are rarely used and almost never tested.
If you are out of memory, you'll probably need to shut down the program, so the reasoning goes that if you try to use a NULL pointer the CPU will do the check for you.
For safety-critical systems, the above argument does not hold, although those systems often forbid the use of dynamically allocated memory entirely.


::: {.tip}
\index{memory leak}
**Tip:** There are no smart pointers in C. There is no RAII. There is no garbage
collector. If you call `malloc`, you *must* call `free` when you are done. If
you forget, you leak memory. If you call `free` twice on the same pointer, you
get undefined behavior. If you use a pointer after freeing it, you get undefined
behavior. Memory management in C is entirely your responsibility.
:::

\index{calloc}
`calloc` is a variant that allocates memory and initializes it to zero:

```c
void *calloc(size_t count, size_t size);
```

```c
int *nums = calloc(5, sizeof(int));  // 5 ints, all initialized to 0
```

\index{realloc}
And `realloc` lets you resize a previously allocated block:

```c
void *realloc(void *ptr, size_t size);
```

```c
nums = realloc(nums, 10 * sizeof(int));  // grow to 10 ints
```

::: {.tip}
**Trap:** Never assign the result of `realloc` directly back to the same pointer.
If `realloc` fails, it returns `NULL` and the original memory is not freed — so
`nums = realloc(nums, ...)` loses your only pointer to the original block,
causing a memory leak. Use a temporary pointer instead:

```c
int *tmp = realloc(nums, 10 * sizeof(int));
if (tmp == NULL) {
    // handle error — nums is still valid
} else {
    nums = tmp;
}
```
:::

## Working with Raw Memory: `memcpy` and `memset`

\index{memcpy}
\index{memset}

Two functions from `<string.h>` operate on raw bytes rather than strings. You
will see them constantly in C code:

`memset` fills a block of memory with a byte value. It is commonly used to zero
out a buffer:

```c
void *memset(void *s, int c, size_t n);
```

```c
int nums[10];
memset(nums, 0, sizeof(nums));   // set all bytes to 0
```

`memcpy` copies a block of bytes from one location to another. Unlike `strcpy`,
it does not stop at a `'\0'` — you tell it exactly how many bytes to copy:

```c
void *memcpy(void *dest, const void *src, size_t n);
```

```c
int src[] = {10, 20, 30};
int dest[3];
memcpy(dest, src, sizeof(src));  // copy all 12 bytes (3 ints × 4 bytes)
```

::: {.tip}
\index{memmove}
**Trap:** `memcpy` requires that the source and destination do not overlap. If
they might overlap (e.g., shifting elements within the same array), use
`memmove` instead, which handles overlapping regions correctly.

```c
void *memmove(void *dest, const void *src, size_t n);
```
:::

## Where Variables Live: A Summary

| Kind | Where | Lifetime | Example |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Global | Data segment | Entire program | `int count = 0;` (outside functions) |
| Local | Stack | Until function returns | `int x = 5;` (inside a function) |
| Static local | Data segment | Entire program | `static int n = 0;` (inside a function) |
| Dynamic | Heap | Until you call `free` | `int *p = malloc(...)` |

## Try It: Memory Lifetimes

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int total = 0;   // global — lives for the whole program

void add_to_total(int n) {
    int local = n;       // local — gone when add_to_total returns
    total += local;
}

int main(void) {
    add_to_total(10);
    add_to_total(20);
    printf("Total: %d\n", total);    // 30

    // dynamic — lives until we free it
    int *data = malloc(3 * sizeof(int));
    if (data == NULL) return 1;

    data[0] = 1985;
    data[1] = 1986;
    data[2] = 1987;

    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        printf("data[%d] = %d\n", i, data[i]);
    }

    free(data);
    return 0;
}
```

## Key Points

- Global variables live for the entire program; local variables live only until
  the function returns.
- Static local variables have the scope of a local but the lifetime of a
  global.
- `malloc` allocates memory on the heap. You must call `free` when done.
- `calloc` allocates and zeroes memory. `realloc` resizes an allocation.
- `memcpy` copies bytes between non-overlapping regions. Use `memmove` for
  overlapping regions.
- `memset` fills a block of memory with a byte value.

## Exercises

1. **Think about it:** Why would you choose `calloc` over `malloc` followed by
   `memset` to zero?

2. **What does this print?**

    ```c
    #include <stdio.h>

    void counter(void) {
        static int n = 0;
        n++;
        printf("%d ", n);
    }

    int main(void) {
        counter(); counter(); counter();
        return 0;
    }
    ```

3. **Calculation:** On a system where `int` is 32 bits, how many bytes does
   `malloc(5 * sizeof(int))` allocate?

4. **Where is the bug?**

    ```c
    int *p = malloc(10 * sizeof(int));
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        p[i] = i;
    }
    free(p);
    printf("%d\n", p[0]);
    ```

5. **Where is the bug?**

    ```c
    int *a = malloc(5 * sizeof(int));
    int *b = a;
    free(a);
    free(b);
    ```

6. **Write a program** that uses `malloc` to allocate an array of `n` integers
   (where `n` is provided by the user via `scanf`), fills the array with
   squares (0, 1, 4, 9, ...), prints them, and frees the memory.

\newpage

\index{string}
# 8. Strings

In C++, you use `std::string` and barely think about what is happening under the
hood. In C, there is no string type at all. \index{null terminator}A "string" in C is just an array of
`char` that ends with a null character `'\0'`. Every string function in C depends
on finding that null terminator to know where the string ends.

## Declaring C Strings

There are several ways to create a string in C:

```c
char greeting[] = "Hola, mundo";        // compiler sizes it: 12 bytes (11 + '\0')
char band[20] = "Depeche Mode";         // 20-byte buffer, only 13 used
char empty[10] = "";                     // 10 bytes, first byte is '\0'
```

When you write `"Hola, mundo"`, the compiler automatically adds a `'\0'` at the
end. The array `greeting` is 12 bytes: 11 visible characters plus the null
terminator.

::: {.tip}
**Trap:** Always remember the null terminator when sizing your buffers. The
string `"hello"` needs 6 bytes, not 5. Off-by-one errors with null terminators
are one of the most common bugs in C.
:::

## String Functions

C provides a library of string manipulation functions in `<string.h>`. These are
the ones you will use most:

\index{strlen}
**`strlen` — Get the Length**

```c
size_t strlen(const char *s);
```

Returns the number of characters before the null terminator:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(void) {
    char song[] = "Take On Me";
    printf("'%s' has %zu characters\n", song, strlen(song));  // 10
    return 0;
}
```

Note that `strlen` does not count the `'\0'`. The array holding `"Take On Me"`
is 11 bytes, but `strlen` returns 10.

\index{strcpy}
\index{strncpy}
**`strcpy` / `strncpy` — Copy a String**

```c
char *strcpy(char *dest, const char *src);
char *strncpy(char *dest, const char *src, size_t n);
```

`strcpy` copies the source string (including the null terminator) into the
destination buffer. You must make sure the destination is large enough:

```c
char dest[20];
strcpy(dest, "Tainted Love");  // copies 13 bytes (12 chars + '\0')
```

`strncpy` is the safer variant — it copies at most `n` characters:

```c
char dest[10];
strncpy(dest, "Enjoy the Silence", 9);
dest[9] = '\0';  // strncpy does NOT guarantee null termination!
```

::: {.tip}
**Wut:** `strncpy` does not null-terminate the destination if the source is
longer than `n`. Always set the last byte yourself:
`dest[sizeof(dest) - 1] = '\0';`
:::

\index{strcmp}
**`strcmp` — Compare Strings**

```c
int strcmp(const char *s1, const char *s2);
```

In C++, you can compare strings with `==`. In C, you cannot — using `==` on
two `char` arrays compares the *addresses*, not the contents. Use `strcmp`
instead:

```c
char a[] = "Rush";
char b[] = "Rush";

if (a == b) {
    // This compares ADDRESSES, not content — almost always false
}

if (strcmp(a, b) == 0) {
    // This compares the actual characters — correct!
    printf("Same band!\n");
}
```

`strcmp` returns 0 if the strings are equal, a negative value if the first is
lexicographically less, and a positive value if it is greater.

::: {.tip}
**Trap:** Yes, `strcmp` returns 0 for equal strings. It is a common source of
confusion. Think of it as returning the "difference" between the strings — zero
means no difference.
:::

\index{strchr}
\index{strrchr}
**`strchr` / `strrchr` — Find a Character**

```c
char *strchr(const char *s, int c);
char *strrchr(const char *s, int c);
```

`strchr` finds the first occurrence of a character. `strrchr` finds the last:

```c
char lyric[] = "Don't You Forget About Me";
char *first_o = strchr(lyric, 'o');    // points to 'o' in "Don't"
char *last_o = strrchr(lyric, 'o');    // points to 'o' in "About"

if (first_o != NULL) {
    printf("First 'o' at position %td\n", first_o - lyric);
}
```

Both functions return a pointer to the found character, or `NULL` if the
character is not in the string.

\index{strstr}
**`strstr` — Find a Substring**

```c
char *strstr(const char *haystack, const char *needle);
```

Finds the first occurrence of a substring within a string:

```c
char title[] = "Blade Runner 1982";
char *found = strstr(title, "Runner");
if (found != NULL) {
    printf("Found: %s\n", found);  // "Runner 1982"
}
```

Like `strchr`, it returns a pointer to the start of the match, or `NULL` if not
found.

\index{strcat}
\index{strncat}
**`strcat` / `strncat` — Concatenate Strings**

```c
char *strcat(char *dest, const char *src);
char *strncat(char *dest, const char *src, size_t n);
```

`strcat` appends one string to the end of another:

```c
char message[50] = "I'll be ";
strcat(message, "back");
printf("%s\n", message);  // "I'll be back"
```

This works fine as long as the destination buffer is large enough. But `strcat`
does not check bounds — if you run out of space, it writes past the end of the
array.

::: {.tip}
\index{buffer overflow}
**Trap:** `strcat` is one of the most dangerous functions in C. It has no way to
know how large the destination buffer is, so it blindly appends bytes. If the
combined strings exceed the buffer size, you get a **buffer overflow** — one of
the most common security vulnerabilities in the history of software. Use
`strncat` instead.
:::

`strncat` takes a maximum number of characters to append as the last argument.
Make sure to leave space for the null terminator, so if there are three bytes left in a buffer, the maximum number of characters to append would be 2.

```c
char buf[20] = "Hello";
strncat(buf, ", World!", sizeof(buf) - strlen(buf) - 1);
```

\index{strdup}
**`strdup` — Duplicate a String**

```c
char *strdup(const char *s);
```

`strdup` allocates new memory on the heap, copies the string into it, and
returns a pointer to the copy. You are responsible for freeing the memory when
you are done:

```c
char *copy = strdup("Video Killed the Radio Star");
printf("%s\n", copy);
free(copy);  // you must free memory allocated by strdup
```

::: {.tip}
**Tip:** `strdup` calls `malloc` internally. Every call to `strdup` must
eventually be paired with a call to `free`. If you forget, you have a memory
leak. Note that `strdup` is a POSIX function, not part of the C standard until
C23. It is available on virtually every system you will use, but compiling with
`-std=c99 -pedantic` or `-std=c11 -pedantic` will produce a warning.
:::

\index{strtok}
**`strtok` — Tokenize a String**

```c
char *strtok(char *str, const char *delim);
```

`strtok` splits a string into tokens separated by any character in a delimiter
set. In C++, you might use `std::istringstream` with `>>` or
`std::string::find` — in C, `strtok` is the standard approach:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(void) {
    char line[] = "Girls Just Want to Have Fun";

    char *tok = strtok(line, " ");
    while (tok != NULL) {
        printf("'%s'\n", tok);
        tok = strtok(NULL, " ");
    }
    return 0;
}
// Output:
// 'Girls'
// 'Just'
// 'Want'
// 'to'
// 'Have'
// 'Fun'
```

The first call passes the string to tokenize. Each subsequent call passes
`NULL` to continue tokenizing the same string. `strtok` returns `NULL` when
there are no more tokens.

There are two important gotchas. First, `strtok` **modifies the original
string** by replacing delimiter characters with `'\0'`. If you need the
original string preserved, make a copy with `strdup` before tokenizing.
Second, `strtok` stores its state in a hidden static variable, which means it
is **not thread-safe** and you cannot tokenize two strings at the same time.

::: {.tip}
\index{strtok\_r}
**Tip:** Use `strtok_r` (POSIX) or `strtok_s` (C11 Annex K / Windows) instead
of `strtok`. These reentrant versions take an extra `char **saveptr` parameter
to store the tokenizer state, making them safe to use in multi-threaded
programs and allowing nested tokenization:

```c
char *strtok_r(char *str, const char *delim, char **saveptr);
```

```c
char *saveptr;
char *tok = strtok_r(line, " ", &saveptr);
while (tok != NULL) {
    printf("'%s'\n", tok);
    tok = strtok_r(NULL, " ", &saveptr);
}
```
:::

## The Dangers of `strcat`

Let's look at a concrete example of why `strcat` is dangerous:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(void) {
    char buf[12] = "Buenas ";    // 7 chars + '\0', 4 bytes remaining

    // "noches" is 6 chars — doesn't fit in 4 remaining bytes!
    strcat(buf, "noches");       // BUFFER OVERFLOW — undefined behavior

    printf("%s\n", buf);         // might print garbage, might crash
    return 0;
}
```

The buffer is 12 bytes, `"Buenas "` uses 8 (including the `'\0'`), and
`"noches"` needs 7 more bytes (including its `'\0'`). That is 14 bytes total in
a 12-byte buffer. The extra bytes overwrite whatever happens to be next to the
buffer in memory, which can corrupt other variables, crash the program, or —
worst of all — create a security exploit.

## A Preview: `sprintf` and `sscanf`

\index{sprintf}
\index{sscanf}

```c
int sprintf(char *str, const char *format, ...);
int sscanf(const char *str, const char *format, ...);
```

C has two powerful functions for building and parsing strings that we will cover
in detail in the Standard I/O chapter: `sprintf` writes formatted output into a string
buffer (like `printf` but to a string), and `sscanf` reads formatted input from
a string (like `scanf` but from a string). They are the C programmer's Swiss
Army knife for string manipulation:

```c
char result[50];
int year = 1985;
sprintf(result, "The year is %d. Que bueno!", year);
// result is now "The year is 1985. Que bueno!"
```

## Try It: String Starter

This program exercises several string functions so you can see them in action:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(void) {
    // strlen
    char song[] = "Sweet Dreams";
    printf("Song: '%s' (%zu chars)\n", song, strlen(song));

    // strcpy
    char copy[20];
    strcpy(copy, song);
    printf("Copy: '%s'\n", copy);

    // strcmp
    printf("Compare '%s' to '%s': %d\n", song, copy, strcmp(song, copy));
    printf("Compare 'A' to 'B': %d\n", strcmp("A", "B"));

    // strcat
    char greeting[30] = "Buenos ";
    strcat(greeting, "dias");
    printf("Greeting: '%s'\n", greeting);

    // strchr and strstr
    char *ch = strchr(song, 'D');
    if (ch) printf("Found 'D' at position %td\n", ch - song);

    char *sub = strstr(song, "Dreams");
    if (sub) printf("Found substring: '%s'\n", sub);

    // strdup
    char *dup = strdup("Never Gonna Give You Up");
    printf("Duplicate: '%s'\n", dup);
    free(dup);

    return 0;
}
```

## Key Points

- C strings are `char` arrays terminated by `'\0'`. There is no `std::string`.
- Always account for the null terminator when sizing buffers.
- Use `strcmp` to compare strings — the `==` operator compares addresses, not
  content.
- `strcpy` and `strcat` do not check buffer bounds. Prefer `strncpy` and
  `strncat`.
- `strdup` allocates memory with `malloc` — you must `free` the result.
- `strtok` splits strings into tokens but modifies the original string and is
  not thread-safe. Use `strtok_r` or `strtok_s` instead.
- `strlen` returns the number of characters *before* the `'\0'`, not the buffer
  size.

## Exercises

1. **Think about it:** Why does `strcmp` return 0 for equal strings rather than
   1? How does this relate to the function's actual purpose?

2. **What does this print?**

    ```c
    char s[] = "Ghostbusters";
    printf("%zu %zu\n", strlen(s), sizeof(s));
    ```

3. **Calculation:** What is `sizeof(buf)` for `char buf[20] = "Hola";`?

4. **Where is the bug?**

    ```c
    char buf[10] = "Livin'";
    strcat(buf, " on a Prayer");
    printf("%s\n", buf);
    ```

5. **Where is the bug?**

    ```c
    char *a = "Hello";
    char *b = "Hello";
    if (a == b) {
        printf("Equal\n");
    } else {
        printf("Not equal\n");
    }
    ```

    (Hint: what does `==` actually compare here? Is the output guaranteed?)

6. **Write a program** that reads a string from the user, reverses it in place
   using pointer arithmetic, and prints the result.

# 9. Numbers and Casting

To the CPU, everything is just a number.
It has no concept of characters, strings, pointers, or objects.
The CPU only knows about the numeric values in registers and memory addresses.

The types we assign to variables in C do not change the underlying bits; they simply tell the *compiler* how we want to interpret and use those numbers.
Different numeric types provide different sizes (which determines the range of values they can hold) and different semantics (like whether they are signed or unsigned, integer or floating-point).

## Everything is a Number

\index{char}
A `char` is just a small integer (usually 8 bits). Assigning `'A'` is exactly the same as assigning the number `65` (in ASCII). You can perform math on characters just as you would on any integer:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    char grade = 'A';
    int score = 65;
    
    // Both variables hold the exact same numeric value
    printf("grade as char: %c, as int: %d\n", grade, grade);
    printf("score as char: %c, as int: %d\n", score, score);
    
    char next_grade = grade + 1; // 65 + 1 = 66
    printf("Next grade: %c\n", next_grade); // 'B'
    
    return 0;
}
```

A pointer is also just a number. Specifically, it is an integer that represents a memory address. When you provide a pointer type like `int *`, you are telling the compiler: "Treat this address number as the location of an `int`." C allows you to print the address just like a number, usually formatted as hexadecimal using the `%p` specifier for pointers:

```c
int val = 1986; // Year "Danger Zone" charted
int *p = &val;

printf("Address: %p\n", (void *)p); // e.g., 0x7ffd9b8
```

## Strings are Not Special

Because everything is just a number, C has no native understanding of "strings." A string in C is merely an array of characters (small integers) that ends with a special `0` byte (the null terminator, `'\0'`). 

When you write a string literal like `"Africa"`, the compiler simply lays out an array of numbers (`65, 102, 114, 105, 99, 97, 0`) in read-only memory and gives you a `char *` pointer to the first number (`65`). The standard libraries (`<string.h>`) are what give us the illusion of strings, by processing these arrays of numbers until they hit that `0` byte.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    char word[] = "Hola";

    printf("String: %s\n", word);
    printf("Bytes: ");
    for (int i = 0; i < (int)sizeof(word); i++)
        printf("%d ", word[i]);
    printf("\n");

    return 0;
}
// Output:
// String: Hola
// Bytes: 72 111 108 97 0
```

The five bytes are the ASCII values for `H`, `o`, `l`, `a`, and the null terminator.

## Converting Strings to Numbers

Because strings are really arrays of characters, the text `"1986"` is entirely different from the integer `1986`. Unsurprisingly, converting between the text representation of a number and its purely numeric form is a very common task.

\index{strtol}
To translate a string representation into an actual integer, use `strtol` (string to long) from `<stdlib.h>`:

```c
long strtol(const char *str, char **endptr, int base);
```

The first argument is the string to parse. The second argument, `endptr`, is an optional pointer that `strtol` sets to point to the first character after the parsed number (pass `NULL` if you don't need it). The third argument is the numeric base (10 for decimal, 16 for hex, 0 to auto-detect from the prefix).

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(void) {
    char *year_str = "1986";
    
    // 10 is the base (base-10 decimal)
    long year = strtol(year_str, NULL, 10);
    
    printf("Year: %ld\n", year);
    return 0;
}
```

\index{strtod}
For floating-point conversions, use `strtod` (string to double) in the same way — it takes a string, an optional `endptr`, but no base argument since floating-point literals are always decimal.

Later on when we discuss Standard I/O, we will cover `sprintf` and `sscanf`, which provide convenient formatting routines to convert back and forth between strings and numbers.

## Integer Types

\index{integer types}

Integers are the most common type of number you will use in C.
The CPU can do arithmetic on integers very quickly, and they are essential for pointer arithmetic and array indexing.
Integers can be signed or unsigned and can be of different sizes.
Here is a table of the common sizes, ranges, and literal suffixes of integers on most 64-bit systems:

| Type | Bytes | Range | Suffix |
|------|:-----:|-------|:------:|
| `signed char` | 1 | $-128$ to $127$ | |
| `unsigned char` | 1 | $0$ to $255$ | |
| `short` | 2 | $-32{,}768$ to $32{,}767$ | |
| `unsigned short` | 2 | $0$ to $65{,}535$ | |
| `int` | 4 | $-2^{31}$ to $2^{31}-1$ | |
| `unsigned int` | 4 | $0$ to $2^{32}-1$ | `U` |
| `long` | 8 | $-2^{63}$ to $2^{63}-1$ | `L` |
| `unsigned long` | 8 | $0$ to $2^{64}-1$ | `UL` |
| `long long` | 8 | $-2^{63}$ to $2^{63}-1$ | `LL` |
| `unsigned long long` | 8 | $0$ to $2^{64}-1$ | `ULL` |

Note that the sizes and ranges specified here can vary.
The C standard's rules about sizes are so vague they aren't worth quoting here :'(.
Notice that the range is 1 number larger for negative numbers than for positive numbers.
This is because most systems use **two's complement** representation for signed integers.
The top bit indicates the sign: if it is set, the number is negative.
But the remaining bits are not a simple magnitude — two's complement encodes negative values so that addition and subtraction work the same way for signed and unsigned numbers.
A consequence of this encoding is that there is one more negative value than positive values, and zero is represented only one way (with the sign bit clear).
While this may not make your math teacher happy, it gets worse when we talk about floating point numbers!

\index{sizeof}
\index{limits.h}
You can explore the actual sizes and ranges on your machine using `<limits.h>`:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <limits.h>

int main(void) {
    printf("char:      %zu byte,  range %d to %d\n",
           sizeof(char), CHAR_MIN, CHAR_MAX);
    printf("short:     %zu bytes, range %d to %d\n",
           sizeof(short), SHRT_MIN, SHRT_MAX);
    printf("int:       %zu bytes, range %d to %d\n",
           sizeof(int), INT_MIN, INT_MAX);
    printf("long:      %zu bytes, range %ld to %ld\n",
           sizeof(long), LONG_MIN, LONG_MAX);
    printf("long long: %zu bytes, range %lld to %lld\n",
           sizeof(long long), LLONG_MIN, LLONG_MAX);

    return 0;
}
```

::: {.tip}
**Trap:** Most integer types are always signed by default, but `char` is different — its signedness is implementation-defined.
Sadly, on x86_64 CPUs, `char` is signed by default, and on ARM CPUs, `char` is unsigned by default! Watch out!
:::

### Integer Promotion

\index{integer promotion}

When you use an integer type in an expression that is equal to or less than the size of `int`, it is automatically promoted to `int` if `int` is large enough to hold all the values of the type. Otherwise, it is promoted to `unsigned int`. This is called integer promotion.

For expressions that involve larger integer types, the rules generally promote to the signedness and the size of the larger type.

::: {.tip}
\index{size\_t}
**Trap:** One place where this can cause problems is when using `strlen`. `strlen` returns a `size_t` which is an unsigned integer type. If you subtract two `size_t` values, the result will be a `size_t`. If the first value is smaller than the second value, the result will be a large positive number. This can cause problems when using the result in other expressions.
:::

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(void) {
    char *a = "Jump";       // strlen = 4
    char *b = "Jump!!!!";   // strlen = 8

    // size_t is unsigned, so 4 - 8 wraps around!
    size_t diff = strlen(a) - strlen(b);
    printf("strlen(a) - strlen(b) = %zu\n", diff);

    // cast to a signed type to get the correct result
    long sdiff = (long)strlen(a) - (long)strlen(b);
    printf("Signed difference:      %ld\n", sdiff);

    return 0;
}
// Output:
// strlen(a) - strlen(b) = 18446744073709551612
// Signed difference:      -4
```

## Floating Point Types

\index{float}
\index{double}

Floating point numbers are used for decimal numbers that may have fractional components.
They also vary in size and precision, but they are always signed.
Here is a table of the common sizes, ranges, and literal suffixes of floating point numbers on most 64-bit systems:

| Type | Size | Range | Literal Suffix |
|------|------|-------|----------------|
| `float` | 4 bytes | -3.4e+38 to 3.4e+38 | `F` |
| `double` | 8 bytes | -1.7e+308 to 1.7e+308 | *(none, default)* |
| `long double` | 16 bytes | -1.2e+4932 to 1.2e+4932 | `L` |

Floating point numbers also have a sign bit, but unlike integers, the sign bit can be set on zero.
This means floating point numbers have two zeros: positive zero and negative zero.
(They compare as equal to each other though.)
Floating point numbers can also be used to represent infinity and NaN (Not a Number).

Floating point numbers cannot always exactly represent a value.
The fractional part of a number is stored as a sum of negative powers of 2 (1/2, 1/4, 1/8, ...).
Values like `0.5` (which is 1/2) and `0.25` (which is 1/4) can be represented exactly, but values like `0.1` and `0.2` cannot.
Rounding is used to get as close as possible to the value you want.
This can cause surprising results: for example, `0.1 + 0.2` is not exactly equal to `0.3`.

Observe the following code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void) {
    float f = 1.2;
    if (f != 1.2) printf("what?!?\n");
    if (f == 1.2f) printf("ok\n");
    return 0;
}
```

You would expect only the `ok` message to print, but the `what` message prints too!
Why?
The literal `1.2` is a `double`. When it is assigned to `f`, the value is rounded to fit in a `float`, losing some precision.
In the first `if`, `f` is promoted back to `double` for the comparison, but the precision lost during the assignment is not recovered, so `f` and `1.2` are not equal.
In the second `if`, `1.2f` is a `float` literal, which was rounded the same way, so the comparison succeeds.

## Casting

\index{cast}

A **cast** is a way of forcing the compiler to treat a value of one type as another type. The syntax is `(type) value`. 

Casts in C are much simpler than in C++.
They are also much less magical!
C has a single unified cast syntax `(type)value`.
You can only cast between numeric types (`scalar` type is the term usually used), including pointers.
The following table summarizes the allowed casts:

| From / To | Integer | Floating-Point | Pointer |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Integer** | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Floating-Point** | Yes | Yes | No |
| **Pointer** | Yes | No | Yes |

Casting from floating point to integer drops the decimal part (it does not round).
As long as the numbers fit into the target type, the conversion works well.
But if the number is too large, you get the dreaded \index{undefined behavior}"undefined behavior" — anything can happen.

Casting from a floating point to a pointer doesn't make sense, but you can do it if you cast to an integer type first.
Why would you ever want to do that though?
Keep your coworkers happy and don't do it.

By using a cast, you are essentially telling the compiler: "I know what I am doing, suppress any warnings, and just treat this as the type I specified."

```c
double pi = 3.14159;
int roughly_pi = (int)pi; // truncates to 3
```

Because C trusts you implicitly, casting can be dangerous. Magic *does not* happen when you cast.

::: {.tip}
**Trap:** A classic beginner mistake is trying to convert a string to an integer by casting the pointer.

```c
char *movie_year = "1985";  // The Goonies
int bad_year = (int)movie_year; // THIS IS A BUG! not 1985!!
```

Casting a `char *` string to an `int` does not convert the text `"1985"` into the number `1985`. It tells the compiler to take the *memory address* where the string is stored and chop or pad it to fit inside an `int`. On a 64-bit system, the pointer is 8 bytes and the `int` is 4 bytes, so compiling this code will actually result in a warning that you are casting a pointer to an integer of different size! Always use functions like `strtol` to parse strings into numbers.
:::

### Casting pointers to other pointers

\index{void pointer}

`void *` is a pointer that can point to anything. It is a pointer to a generic memory location.
This is why you don't have to cast pointers returned by `malloc` to a specific pointer type.

Take care when casting pointers to other pointer types.
You must understand the memory layout of the structures you are working with.
One common pattern is using a `char *` for byte-level arithmetic on a base address plus an offset, and then casting the result to the desired structure pointer type.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    int nums[] = {1984, 1985, 1986, 1987};

    void *vp = nums;            // any pointer converts to void *
    int *ip = (int *)vp;        // cast back to use it
    printf("First: %d\n", ip[0]);

    // byte-level access with char *
    char *bp = (char *)nums;
    printf("First byte of nums[0]: 0x%02x\n", (unsigned char)bp[0]);

    return 0;
}
// Output:
// First: 1984
// First byte of nums[0]: 0xc0
```

## Try It: Numbers Starter

This program exercises the key concepts from this chapter: characters as numbers, string-to-number conversion, integer sizes, and casting.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <limits.h>

int main(void) {
    // Characters are just numbers
    char ch = 'A';
    printf("'%c' is %d\n", ch, ch);
    printf("'%c' + 3 = '%c' (%d)\n", ch, ch + 3, ch + 3);

    // Strings are arrays of numbers
    char title[] = "Rio";
    printf("\"%s\" bytes: ", title);
    for (int i = 0; i < (int)sizeof(title); i++)
        printf("%d ", title[i]);
    printf("\n");

    // String to number conversion
    char *bpm_str = "120";
    long bpm = strtol(bpm_str, NULL, 10);
    printf("\"%s\" as a number: %ld\n", bpm_str, bpm);

    // Hex string to number
    long color = strtol("FF8000", NULL, 16);
    printf("0x%lX = %ld\n", color, color);

    // Integer sizes on this machine
    printf("\nsizeof(char)  = %zu\n", sizeof(char));
    printf("sizeof(short) = %zu\n", sizeof(short));
    printf("sizeof(int)   = %zu\n", sizeof(int));
    printf("sizeof(long)  = %zu\n", sizeof(long));
    printf("UINT_MAX      = %u\n", UINT_MAX);

    // Casting: float to int truncates
    double tempo = 120.7;
    int whole = (int)tempo;
    printf("\n(int)%.1f = %d\n", tempo, whole);

    // The classic trap: casting a pointer
    char *year_str = "1982";
    long bad  = (long)year_str;          // address, not 1982!
    long good = strtol(year_str, NULL, 10);
    printf("(long)\"1982\"        = %ld (an address!)\n", bad);
    printf("strtol(\"1982\", ...) = %ld\n", good);

    // void * round-trip
    int val = 42;
    void *vp = &val;
    int *ip = (int *)vp;
    printf("\nvoid * round-trip: %d\n", *ip);

    int hex_val = 0xbadd00d;
    printf("%d %x\n", hex_val, hex_val);
    // let's look at the bytes of hex_val (int has 4 bytes)
    unsigned char *raw = (unsigned char *)&hex_val;
    printf("little-endian: %02x %02x %02x %02x\n",
           raw[0], raw[1], raw[2], raw[3]);

    return 0;
}
```

## Key Points

- Under the hood, everything (characters, pointers) is just a number.
- C does not have native "strings," only arrays of numbers ended with a `0`.
- The type of a variable tells the compiler how you intend to interpret its numeric bits.
- C casts `(type) value` assert your intent to the compiler. It assumes you know what you are doing.
- Casting a pointer to an integer simply gives you the raw numeric memory address, not the parsed contents of a string. Use `strtol` to parse strings.

## Exercises

1. **Think about it:** C++ provides several different cast operators (`static_cast`, `reinterpret_cast`, etc.) whereas C provides only one. What are the advantages of C++'s approach over C's single cast syntax?
2. **What does this print?**

    ```c
    char letter = 'C';
    printf("%c %d\n", letter + 2, letter + 2);
    ```

3. **Calculation:** Assuming a 64-bit system where pointers are 8 bytes and `int` is 4 bytes, what is the output of `sizeof("Danger")` and what is the output of `sizeof((int)0)`?
4. **Where is the bug?**

    ```c
    #include <stdio.h>

    int main(void) {
        char *score_str = "100";
        int score = (int)score_str;
        printf("You got a %d percent!\n", score);
        return 0;
    }
    ```

5. **Write a program** that declares a `double` variable with a fractional component and uses casting to separate the integer part from the fractional part. Print both pieces.

\newpage

# 10. Standard I/O

C's `<stdio.h>` library is your replacement for C++ `iostream`. It provides
`printf` and `scanf` for formatted output and input, file operations with
`fopen` and `fclose`, and binary I/O with `fread` and `fwrite`. Everything
\index{FILE}
flows through the `FILE *` type — an opaque pointer to a structure that tracks
the state of an I/O stream.

## `scanf` for Input

\index{scanf}

```c
int scanf(const char *format, ...);
```

You have already seen `printf` for output. For input, C uses `scanf`, which
reads formatted data from standard input:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    int year;
    printf("Enter a year: ");
    scanf("%d", &year);
    printf("You entered: %d\n", year);
    return 0;
}
```

Notice the `&` before `year`. Since C is pass by value, `scanf` needs the
*address* of the variable so it can store the result there. Forgetting the `&`
is a classic bug — the program compiles but crashes or produces garbage at
runtime.

`scanf` uses similar format specifiers to `printf`, but not identical ones.
Notably, `scanf` uses `%lf` for `double` while `printf` uses `%f`:


```c
char name[50];
double gpa;
scanf("%s %lf", name, &gpa);
```

Note that `name` does not need `&` because an array name already points to the bytes we want to read into.
But `gpa` does need a `&`, because `scanf` needs to know where `gpa` is stored to fill it in.

::: {.tip}
**Trap:** `scanf("%s", ...)` reads a single word (stopping at whitespace). It
also has no bounds checking — it will happily overflow your buffer. Use a
width specifier like `%49s` to limit input to 49 characters (plus `'\0'`).
:::

## Scan Sets

\index{scan set}

`scanf` supports **scan set specifiers** with `%[...]`, which let you define
exactly which characters to accept. The scan set reads characters as long as
they are in the set, and stops at the first character that is not:

```c
char vowels[20];
scanf("%19[aeiouAEIOU]", vowels);  // reads only vowels, stops at first non-vowel
```

A caret `^` at the start of the set **negates** it — read everything *except*
the listed characters. This gives you a way to read an entire line with `scanf`,
since `%[^\n]` reads everything up to (but not including) the newline:

```c
char line[80];
scanf("%79[^\n]", line);   // reads a full line (up to 79 chars)
printf("You said: %s\n", line);
```

Always include a width limit to prevent buffer overflow, just like with `%s`.

Scan sets work with `sscanf` too. Here is an example that parses a structured
string:

```c
char buf[] = "Track 03: 99 Luftballons";
int track;
char title[50];
sscanf(buf, "Track %d: %49[^\n]", &track, title);
// track is 3, title is "99 Luftballons"
```

::: {.tip}
**Tip:** `%[^\n]` is the `scanf` way to read a line, but `fgets` is generally
safer and simpler for line-oriented input. Use scan sets when you need to parse
structured input where only certain characters are valid.
:::

## The `%m` Modifier (POSIX)

With `%s` and `%[...]`, you must always provide a buffer that is large enough.
The POSIX `%m` modifier (called the **assignment-allocation** modifier) tells
`scanf` to `malloc` the buffer for you. Instead of passing a `char[]`, you pass
a `char **` and `scanf` allocates exactly enough memory:

```c
char *line = NULL;
scanf("%m[^\n]", &line);       // scanf mallocs the buffer
printf("You said: %s\n", line);
free(line);                     // you must free it
```

Notice `&line` — `scanf` needs a pointer to your `char *` so it can fill it in
with the address of the newly allocated buffer. This eliminates buffer overflow
risk entirely, since the buffer is always the right size.

`%ms` works the same way for single words:

```c
char *word = NULL;
scanf("%ms", &word);   // reads one word, malloc'd to fit
free(word);
```

::: {.tip}
**Tip:** `%m` is a POSIX extension (available on Linux, macOS, and most Unix
systems) and is not part of the C standard. It will not work with MSVC on
Windows. When portability is not a concern, `%m` is an excellent way to avoid
buffer sizing headaches.
:::

## `stdin`, `stdout`, and `stderr`

\index{stdin}
\index{stdout}
\index{stderr}

When your C program starts, three streams (of type `FILE *`) are already open:

| Stream | Purpose | C++ equivalent |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `stdin` | Standard input (keyboard) | `std::cin` |
| `stdout` | Standard output (screen) | `std::cout` |
| `stderr` | Standard error (screen) | `std::cerr` |

`printf(...)` is actually shorthand for `fprintf(stdout, ...)`. You can write
to `stderr` for error messages:

```c
fprintf(stderr, "Error: file not found\n");
```

Error messages sent to `stderr` are not affected by output redirection
(`./program > output.txt` only redirects `stdout`), so error messages still
appear on the screen.
`./program 2> err.txt` will redirect errors to `err.txt` and `stdout` will appear on the screen.

## `fprintf` and `fscanf`

\index{fprintf}
\index{fscanf}

```c
int fprintf(FILE *stream, const char *format, ...);
int fscanf(FILE *stream, const char *format, ...);
```

`fprintf` and `fscanf` are the file versions of `printf` and `scanf`. They take
a `FILE *` as the first argument:

```c
fprintf(stdout, "Hello\n");           // same as printf("Hello\n")
fprintf(stderr, "Something broke\n"); // write to stderr
```

More usefully, you can use them with files you have opened yourself. Here is
`fscanf` reading from a file:

```c
FILE *f = fopen("scores.txt", "r");
if (f != NULL) {
    char name[50];
    int score;
    while (fscanf(f, "%49s %d", name, &score) == 2) {
        printf("%s scored %d\n", name, score);
    }
    fclose(f);
}
```

`fscanf` returns the number of items successfully read, so checking the return
value tells you whether the read succeeded.

## Opening and Closing Files

\index{fopen}
\index{fclose}

```c
FILE *fopen(const char *path, const char *mode);
int fclose(FILE *stream);
```

To read or write a file, you open it with `fopen` and close it with `fclose`:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    FILE *f = fopen("log.txt", "w");
    if (f == NULL) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Cannot open file\n");
        return 1;
    }

    fprintf(f, "Under Pressure\n");
    fprintf(f, "Year: %d\n", 1981);

    fclose(f);
    return 0;
}
```

The second argument to `fopen` is the **mode string**:

| Mode | Meaning |
|:---|:---|
| `"r"` | Read (file must exist) |
| `"w"` | Write (creates or truncates) |
| `"a"` | Append (creates or appends) |
| `"r+"` | Read and write (file must exist) |
| `"w+"` | Read and write (creates or truncates) |
| `"a+"` | Read and append |

To open a file in **binary mode**, add `b` to the mode string: `"rb"`, `"wb"`,
`"ab"`, etc. On Unix systems, binary and text modes behave identically. On
Windows, text mode translates `\r\n` to `\n` on input and vice versa on
output — binary mode does not.

## `sprintf` and `sscanf`

`sprintf` writes formatted output into a string buffer instead of a stream.
`sscanf` reads formatted input from a string:

```c
char buf[100];
sprintf(buf, "Track %02d: %s", 3, "99 Luftballons");
// buf is now "Track 03: 99 Luftballons"

int track;
char title[50];
sscanf(buf, "Track %d: %49[^\n]", &track, title);
// track is 3, title is "99 Luftballons"
```

::: {.tip}
\index{snprintf}
**Trap:** `sprintf` has the same buffer overflow risk as `strcpy` — it does not
check the size of the destination buffer. Use `snprintf` for safety:

```c
int snprintf(char *str, size_t size, const char *format, ...);
```

```c
snprintf(buf, sizeof(buf), "Track %02d: %s", 3, "99 Luftballons");
```

`snprintf` guarantees it will not write more than `sizeof(buf)` bytes,
including the null terminator.
:::

`asprintf` (POSIX) goes one step further — it `malloc`s a buffer that is
exactly the right size, so you never have to guess:

```c
int asprintf(char **strp, const char *format, ...);
```

```c
char *msg;
asprintf(&msg, "Track %02d: %s", 3, "Mis Ojos Lloran Por Ti");
printf("%s\n", msg);   // "Track 03: Mis Ojos Lloran Por Ti"
free(msg);              // you must free it
```

Like `%m` in `scanf`, you pass a pointer to a `char *` and `asprintf` fills it
in with the address of the newly allocated string. It returns the number of
characters written, or -1 on failure.

::: {.tip}
**Tip:** `asprintf` is a POSIX/GNU extension, not part of the C standard. It is
available on Linux, macOS, and most Unix systems but not MSVC. When it is
available, it is the safest and most convenient way to build formatted strings —
no buffer sizing, no truncation, no overflow.
:::

## Binary I/O: `fread` and `fwrite`

\index{fread}
\index{fwrite}

```c
size_t fread(void *ptr, size_t size, size_t count, FILE *stream);
size_t fwrite(const void *ptr, size_t size, size_t count, FILE *stream);
```

For reading and writing raw binary data (not text), use `fread` and `fwrite`:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    int nums[] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};

    // Write binary data
    FILE *f = fopen("data.bin", "wb");
    fwrite(nums, sizeof(int), 5, f);
    fclose(f);

    // Read it back
    int result[5];
    f = fopen("data.bin", "rb");
    fread(result, sizeof(int), 5, f);
    fclose(f);

    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        printf("%d ", result[i]);   // 10 20 30 40 50
    }
    printf("\n");
    return 0;
}
```

Both functions take four arguments: a pointer to the data, the size of each
element, the number of elements, and the file stream. `fwrite` returns the
number of elements successfully written; `fread` returns the number of elements
successfully read.

## Reading Lines: `fgets`

\index{fgets}

```c
char *fgets(char *s, int size, FILE *stream);
```

`fgets` reads a line from a stream into a buffer. It stops when it has read
`size - 1` characters, encounters a newline (which it includes in the buffer),
or reaches end of file. It always null-terminates the result:

```c
char line[80];
while (fgets(line, sizeof(line), f) != NULL) {
    printf("%s", line);   // line already includes '\n'
}
```

`fgets` returns `NULL` at end of file or on error, making it easy to use in a
loop. It is generally safer than `scanf` for reading lines because it always
respects the buffer size.

## Buffering and `fflush`

\index{buffering}
\index{fflush}

`stdio` does not write directly to the output device on every call. Instead, it
accumulates data in an internal buffer and writes it in larger chunks for
efficiency. There are three buffering modes:

- **Full buffering:** Output is written when the buffer is full (default for
  files).
- **Line buffering:** Output is written when a `\n` is encountered (default for
  `stdout` when connected to a terminal).
- **Unbuffered:** Output is written immediately (default for `stderr`).

This means that `printf("Working...")` (no newline) will not appear on screen
immediately when `stdout` goes to a terminal, and will not
appear when redirected to a file until the buffer fills or the program exits. Use `fflush` to force the buffer
to be written:

```c
int fflush(FILE *stream);
```

```c
printf("Working...");
fflush(stdout);   // force output to appear now
// ... long computation ...
printf(" done!\n");
```

::: {.tip}
**Trap:** When `stdout` is connected to a terminal, output is **line
buffered** — a `\n` triggers a flush. When `stdout` is redirected to a file or
pipe, it is **fully buffered** — output may not appear until the buffer fills
up or the program exits. If you need output to appear immediately (e.g.,
progress indicators), call `fflush(stdout)` after printing. `stderr` is always
unbuffered, which is why error messages appear immediately.
:::

## Try It: Standard I/O Starter

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(void) {
    // sprintf: format into a string
    char buf[100];
    sprintf(buf, "Track %02d: %s", 7, "Hungry Like the Wolf");
    printf("sprintf: %s\n", buf);

    // snprintf: safe version with size limit
    char small[15];
    snprintf(small, sizeof(small), "Year: %d", 1984);
    printf("snprintf: %s\n", small);

    // sscanf: parse from a string
    int track;
    char title[50];
    sscanf(buf, "Track %d: %49[^\n]", &track, title);
    printf("sscanf: track=%d title='%s'\n", track, title);

    // fprintf to stderr
    fprintf(stderr, "This goes to stderr\n");

    // fwrite/fread round-trip
    int nums[] = {10, 20, 30};
    FILE *f = fopen("/tmp/tryit_data.bin", "wb");
    fwrite(nums, sizeof(int), 3, f);
    fclose(f);

    int result[3];
    f = fopen("/tmp/tryit_data.bin", "rb");
    fread(result, sizeof(int), 3, f);
    fclose(f);

    printf("fread: %d %d %d\n", result[0], result[1], result[2]);

    return 0;
}
```

## Key Points

- `printf` writes to `stdout`; `fprintf` writes to any `FILE *`.
- `scanf` needs the address (`&`) of each variable — arrays are the exception
  since they decay to pointers.
- `fopen` returns `NULL` on failure — always check before using the file
  pointer.
- Add `"b"` to the mode string for binary files. This matters on Windows.
- `fread` and `fwrite` transfer raw bytes — no format conversion.
- `stdout` is line buffered at a terminal and fully buffered when redirected.
  Use `fflush` when you need output immediately.

## Exercises

1. **Think about it:** Why does `scanf` need the `&` operator for scalar
   variables but not for arrays?

2. **What does this print?**

    ```c
    char buf[50];
    sprintf(buf, "%s: %d", "Score", 100);
    printf("%zu\n", strlen(buf));
    ```

3. **Calculation:** If `buf` is declared as `char buf[20]` and you call
   `snprintf(buf, sizeof(buf), "Year: %d", 1984)`, how many characters
   (excluding the null terminator) are written to `buf`?

4. **Where is the bug?**

    ```c
    int x;
    scanf("%d", x);
    ```

5. **Where is the bug?**

    ```c
    FILE *f = fopen("noexist.txt", "r");
    fprintf(f, "Hello\n");
    fclose(f);
    ```

6. **Think about it:** You run `./program > output.txt` and your program
   contains both `printf` and `fprintf(stderr, ...)` calls. Which messages
   appear in `output.txt` and which appear on the screen? Why?

7. **Write a program** that opens a text file, writes five lines to it (your
   choice of content), closes it, reopens it for reading, reads and prints each
   line using `fgets`, then closes it again.

# 11. Low-Level I/O

The `<stdio.h>` functions you learned in the previous chapter are built on top
of a lower-level I/O interface provided by the operating system. These system
calls — `read`, `write`, `open`, and `close` — work directly with **file
descriptors** rather than `FILE *` pointers. You will encounter them in systems
programming, and understanding them helps you see what `stdio` is actually
doing under the hood.

## File Descriptors

\index{file descriptor}

A file descriptor is a small non-negative integer that the operating system
uses to identify an open file (or pipe, socket, device, etc.). When your
program starts, three file descriptors are already open:

| File Descriptor | POSIX Name | Purpose |
|:---|:---|:---|
| 0 | `STDIN_FILENO` | Standard input |
| 1 | `STDOUT_FILENO` | Standard output |
| 2 | `STDERR_FILENO` | Standard error |

\index{unistd.h}
These constants are defined in `<unistd.h>`. They correspond to `stdin`,
`stdout`, and `stderr` from `<stdio.h>`, but at a lower level.

## `read` and `write`

\index{read}
\index{write}

```c
ssize_t read(int fd, void *buf, size_t count);
ssize_t write(int fd, const void *buf, size_t count);
```

The `read` and `write` system calls transfer raw bytes between a file
descriptor and a buffer:

```c
#include <unistd.h>

// write(fd, buffer, count) — returns bytes written
write(1, "Blue Monday\n", 12);   // write 12 bytes to stdout

// read(fd, buffer, count) — returns bytes read
char buf[100];
ssize_t n = read(0, buf, sizeof(buf));  // read from stdin
write(1, buf, n);                        // echo it back
```

`read` returns the number of bytes actually read (which may be less than
requested), 0 at end of file, or -1 on error. `write` returns the number of
bytes actually written, or -1 on error.

Unlike `printf` and `scanf`, these functions perform no formatting — they
transfer raw bytes. There are no format specifiers, no newline handling, no
buffering.

## `open` and `close`

\index{open}
\index{close}

```c
int open(const char *path, int flags, ... /* mode_t mode */);
int close(int fd);
```

\index{fcntl.h}
To open a file at the system call level, use `open` from `<fcntl.h>`:

```c
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int fd = open("data.txt", O_RDONLY);
if (fd == -1) {
    write(2, "Cannot open file\n", 17);
    return 1;
}

char buf[256];
ssize_t n = read(fd, buf, sizeof(buf));
write(1, buf, n);

close(fd);
```

The second argument to `open` is a set of flags combined with bitwise OR:

| Flag | Purpose |
|:---|:---|
| `O_RDONLY` | Open for reading only |
| `O_WRONLY` | Open for writing only |
| `O_RDWR` | Open for reading and writing |
| `O_CREAT` | Create the file if it does not exist |
| `O_TRUNC` | Truncate the file to zero length |
| `O_APPEND` | Append to the file |

To **create a new file** (or truncate an existing one), combine flags:

```c
int fd = open("output.txt", O_WRONLY | O_CREAT | O_TRUNC, 0644);
```

The third argument (`0644`) is the **file permissions** — only used with
`O_CREAT`. The value `0644` means the owner can read and write, and everyone
else can only read.

There is also `creat`, which is equivalent to `open` with
`O_WRONLY | O_CREAT | O_TRUNC`:

```c
int creat(const char *path, mode_t mode);
```

```c
int fd = creat("output.txt", 0644);
// same as: open("output.txt", O_WRONLY | O_CREAT | O_TRUNC, 0644)
```

::: {.tip}
**Wut:** Yes, it is `creat` with no `e`. Ken Thompson was once asked what he
would do differently if he were redesigning Unix. His answer: "I'd spell creat
with an e."
:::

## Seeking: `lseek`

\index{lseek}

```c
off_t lseek(int fd, off_t offset, int whence);
```

`lseek` repositions the file offset for an open file descriptor:

```c
#include <unistd.h>

lseek(fd, 0, SEEK_SET);     // go to beginning
lseek(fd, 0, SEEK_END);     // go to end
lseek(fd, 100, SEEK_SET);   // go to byte 100

off_t pos = lseek(fd, 0, SEEK_CUR);  // get current position (no move)
```

\index{SEEK\_SET}
\index{SEEK\_CUR}
\index{SEEK\_END}
The three `SEEK_` constants control where the offset is relative to:

| Constant | Meaning |
|:---|:---|
| `SEEK_SET` | Relative to the beginning of the file |
| `SEEK_CUR` | Relative to the current position |
| `SEEK_END` | Relative to the end of the file |

`lseek` returns the new offset from the beginning of the file, or -1 on error.

::: {.tip}
**Tip:** In `<stdio.h>`, the equivalent functions are `fseek` and `ftell`. The
low-level `lseek` combines both: calling `lseek(fd, 0, SEEK_CUR)` returns the
current position without moving, just like `ftell`.
:::

## `pread` and `pwrite`

\index{pread}
\index{pwrite}

```c
ssize_t pread(int fd, void *buf, size_t count, off_t offset);
ssize_t pwrite(int fd, const void *buf, size_t count, off_t offset);
```

`pread` and `pwrite` are like `read` and `write` but take an explicit offset
instead of using (or modifying) the file's current position:

```c
// Read 100 bytes starting at offset 200, without changing the file position
ssize_t n = pread(fd, buf, 100, 200);

// Write 50 bytes at offset 0, without changing the file position
pwrite(fd, data, 50, 0);
```

These are useful in multi-threaded programs where multiple threads share a file
descriptor — since they do not modify the file position, there is no race
condition.

## Try It: Low-Level I/O Starter

```c
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    // write to stdout using file descriptor 1
    const char *msg = "Low-level I/O starter\n";
    write(STDOUT_FILENO, msg, strlen(msg));

    // open, write, close
    int fd = open("/tmp/tryit_lowio.txt", O_WRONLY | O_CREAT | O_TRUNC, 0644);
    if (fd == -1) {
        write(STDERR_FILENO, "open failed\n", 12);
        return 1;
    }

    const char *lines[] = {"Come As You Are\n", "Year: 1992\n"};
    for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++)
        write(fd, lines[i], strlen(lines[i]));
    close(fd);

    // open, read, print
    fd = open("/tmp/tryit_lowio.txt", O_RDONLY);
    char buf[256];
    ssize_t n = read(fd, buf, sizeof(buf));
    write(STDOUT_FILENO, buf, n);

    // lseek: go back to start and read again
    lseek(fd, 0, SEEK_SET);
    n = read(fd, buf, sizeof(buf));
    printf("Read %zd bytes on second pass\n", n);

    close(fd);
    return 0;
}

## Key Points

- File descriptors are small integers: 0 is stdin, 1 is stdout, 2 is stderr.
- `read` and `write` transfer raw bytes — no formatting, no buffering.
- `open` returns a file descriptor; `fopen` returns a `FILE *`. They are
  different levels of abstraction.
- Use `O_CREAT` with `open` to create files. Always provide a permissions
  argument when using `O_CREAT`.
- `lseek` repositions the read/write offset. Use `SEEK_SET`, `SEEK_CUR`, or
  `SEEK_END`.
- `pread` and `pwrite` read/write at a specific offset without changing the
  file position.

## Exercises

1. **Think about it:** Why would you use low-level `read`/`write` instead of
   `fprintf`/`fscanf`? When would `stdio` be the better choice?

2. **What does this print?**

    ```c
    write(1, "ABC", 3);
    write(1, "DEF\n", 4);
    ```

3. **Calculation:** If `read(fd, buf, 1024)` returns 512, what does that tell
   you? Does it mean there was an error?

4. **Where is the bug?**

    ```c
    int fd = open("newfile.txt", O_WRONLY | O_CREAT);
    write(fd, "Hello\n", 6);
    close(fd);
    ```

5. **Think about it:** Explain the difference between
   `lseek(fd, 0, SEEK_END)` and `lseek(fd, -1, SEEK_END)`. What does each
   return?

6. **Write a program** that uses low-level I/O (`open`, `read`, `write`,
   `close`) to copy the contents of one file to another. The source and
   destination filenames should be taken from `argv`.

# 12. Odds and Ends

This chapter covers a few remaining topics that do not fit neatly into the
previous chapters but are important for writing real C programs and for working
with C code from C++.

## `exit` vs `return`

\index{exit}

```c
void exit(int status);
```

You already know that `return` in `main` ends the program. The `exit` function
from `<stdlib.h>` does the same thing, but it can be called from *any*
function — not just `main`:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void check_file(const char *path) {
    FILE *f = fopen(path, "r");
    if (f == NULL) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Fatal: cannot open %s\n", path);
        exit(1);   // end the program immediately
    }
    // ... work with the file ...
    fclose(f);
}
```

`exit` is useful when an error deep inside a call chain is unrecoverable and
there is no reasonable way to propagate the error back through multiple layers
of callers. In C++, you would throw an exception; in C, `exit` is sometimes the
pragmatic choice.

\index{atexit}
`exit` also flushes all open `stdio` streams and calls any functions registered
with `atexit` before terminating the program.

```c
int atexit(void (*func)(void));
```

::: {.tip}
**Tip:** Use `exit` sparingly. It is a blunt instrument — it ends the entire
program immediately, skipping any cleanup code in calling functions. If you can
reasonably propagate an error code back to `main` and let `main` return, prefer
that approach. Reserve `exit` for truly fatal errors.
:::

## `extern "C"` — Calling C from C++

\index{extern ""C""}

If you are writing C++ code that needs to call functions from a C library, you
need `extern "C"`. The reason: C++ **mangles** function names to support
overloading (so `void foo(int)` and `void foo(double)` have different symbol
names), but C does not. Without `extern "C"`, the C++ linker looks for the
mangled name and cannot find the C function.

```cpp
// In your C++ code:
extern "C" {
    #include "my_c_library.h"   // treat these declarations as C
}
```

Or for a single function:

```cpp
extern "C" void c_function(int x);
```

Many C headers protect themselves with this pattern so they work from both C
and C++:

```c
#ifdef __cplusplus
extern "C" {
#endif

void some_function(int x);
int another_function(const char *s);

#ifdef __cplusplus
}
#endif
```

The `__cplusplus` macro is only defined when compiling with a C++ compiler, so
the `extern "C"` wrapper only appears in C++ compilation.

::: {.tip}
**Tip:** The reason C++ mangles names is to support **function overloading** —
having multiple functions with the same name but different parameter types. C
has no function overloading. Every function name must be unique. If you need
two functions that do the same thing for different types, you give them
different names — for example, `abs` for `int`, `fabs` for `double`, and
`labs` for `long`. The upside is that when you see a function call in C, you
know exactly which function will be invoked — there is only one version.
:::

## Pointer Ownership

\index{pointer!ownership}

In C++, smart pointers make ownership clear: a `std::unique_ptr` owns the
memory, and when it goes out of scope, the memory is freed. In C, there are no
smart pointers. When a function returns a pointer, you must ask: **who owns
this memory?**

There are three common patterns:

**1. The caller owns it (you must free).** The function allocates memory and
hands ownership to you:

```c
char *copy = strdup("Everybody Wants to Rule the World");
// You own this memory. You must free it.
free(copy);
```

**2. The library owns it (do not free).** The function returns a pointer to
memory it manages internally:

```c
struct hostent *h = gethostbyname("example.com");
// The library owns this. Do NOT free it.
```

**3. You own it (you passed it in).** You allocated the memory and passed a
pointer to the function. The function used it but did not take ownership:

```c
char buf[100];
fgets(buf, sizeof(buf), stdin);
// You still own buf. Nothing to free (it's on the stack).
```

::: {.tip}
\index{dangling pointer}
\index{use-after-free}
\index{double free}
**Trap:** Always read the documentation of a C function that returns a pointer.
Look for words like "the caller must free the returned pointer" or "the
returned pointer points to a static buffer." If the documentation does not say,
look at the source code. Getting ownership wrong leads to either memory leaks
(never freeing) or double-free bugs (freeing what you do not own).
:::

## Error Handling Without Exceptions

In C++, you can `throw` an exception and let a `catch` block handle it several
call levels up. C has no exceptions. Error handling is done through return
codes, and cleanup is your responsibility.

The simplest pattern is to check return values and bail out:

```c
void perror(const char *s);
```

```c
FILE *f = fopen("La Isla Bonita.txt", "r");
if (!f) {
    perror("fopen");
    return -1;
}
```

\index{goto}
But what happens when a function acquires multiple resources? You need to
release them in the correct order when something goes wrong. The idiomatic
C pattern uses `goto` to jump to cleanup labels:

```c
int process(const char *path) {
    int status = -1;

    FILE *f = fopen(path, "r");
    if (!f) return -1;

    char *buf = malloc(1024);
    if (!buf) goto close_file;

    char *line = malloc(256);
    if (!line) goto free_buf;

    /* do work with f, buf, and line ... */
    status = 0;

    free(line);
free_buf:
    free(buf);
close_file:
    fclose(f);
    return status;
}
```

Each resource acquired gets a corresponding cleanup label below it. If any
allocation fails, control jumps to the label that releases everything acquired
so far, in reverse order. This pattern is used extensively in real C code
including the Linux kernel.

::: {.tip}
**Wut:** C++ programmers are taught "never use `goto`." In C, `goto` for
cleanup is an accepted and widely used idiom. It is the closest thing C has
to RAII — a structured way to ensure resources are always released.
:::

\index{errno}
\index{perror}
The other common strategy is to return an error code (often `-1` or `NULL`)
and let the caller decide what to do. Many C library functions set the global
variable `errno` to indicate what went wrong, and you can use `perror` or
`strerror(errno)` to get a human-readable message:

```c
char *strerror(int errnum);
```

```c
FILE *f = fopen("No Existe.txt", "r");
if (!f) {
    perror("fopen");    // prints: fopen: No such file or directory
}
```

## `qsort` — Function Pointers in Action

\index{qsort}

You learned about function pointers in the Functions chapter. The most common
place you will encounter them in practice is the standard
library function `qsort` from `<stdlib.h>`. In C++, you would use
`std::sort` with a lambda or comparator. In C, `qsort` takes a comparison
function pointer:

```c
void qsort(void *base, size_t nel, size_t width,
           int (*compar)(const void *, const void *));
```

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

int compare_ints(const void *a, const void *b) {
    int ia = *(const int *)a;
    int ib = *(const int *)b;
    return (ia > ib) - (ia < ib);
}

int main(void) {
    int years[] = {1989, 1982, 1985, 1980, 1987};
    int n = sizeof(years) / sizeof(years[0]);

    qsort(years, n, sizeof(int), compare_ints);

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("%d ", years[i]);
    }
    printf("\n");
    // Output: 1980 1982 1985 1987 1989
    return 0;
}
```

`qsort` takes four arguments: the array, the number of elements, the size of
each element, and a pointer to a comparison function. The comparison function
receives `const void *` pointers — you must cast them to the correct type
inside the function. It returns a negative value if the first argument is less
than the second, zero if equal, and a positive value if greater.

You can sort anything with `qsort` by writing different comparison functions.
Here is one that sorts strings:

```c
int compare_strings(const void *a, const void *b) {
    const char *sa = *(const char **)a;
    const char *sb = *(const char **)b;
    return strcmp(sa, sb);
}

int main(void) {
    const char *songs[] = {
        "Maniac", "Footloose", "Flashdance", "Fame"
    };
    int n = sizeof(songs) / sizeof(songs[0]);

    qsort(songs, n, sizeof(char *), compare_strings);

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("%s\n", songs[i]);
    }
    // Output:
    // Fame
    // Flashdance
    // Footloose
    // Maniac
    return 0;
}
```

Notice the double cast in `compare_strings`: `qsort` passes a pointer *to*
each array element, and each element is already a `char *`, so you receive a
`char **` disguised as `const void *`.

::: {.tip}
**Wut:** A common mistake is to write `return a - b` in integer comparison
functions. This can overflow when `a` and `b` have very different signs (e.g.,
`INT_MAX - (-1)` overflows). The pattern `(a > b) - (a < b)` is safe and
returns -1, 0, or 1.
:::

## Try It: Odds and Ends Starter

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

// A comparison function for qsort
// a normal numeric sort, but we want 1982 to always be first
// because we are big thriller fans!
int compare_ints(const void *a, const void *b) {
    int ia = *(const int *)a;
    int ib = *(const int *)b;
    // 1982 always appears first (Thriller came out in 1982)
    if (ia == 1982 && ib == 1982) return 0;
    if (ia == 1982) return -1;
    if (ib == 1982) return 1;
    // Overflow-safe alternative to (ia - ib). The three cases:
    //   ia > ib  → (1) - (0) =  1
    //   ia == ib → (0) - (0) =  0
    //   ia < ib  → (0) - (1) = -1
    return (ia > ib) - (ia < ib);
}

void goodbye(void) {
    printf("atexit: Adios!\n");
}

int main(void) {
    atexit(goodbye);

    // Function pointer
    int (*cmp)(const void *, const void *) = compare_ints;
    int x = 10, y = 20;
    printf("compare(10, 20) = %d\n", cmp(&x, &y));

    // qsort
    int years[] = {1987, 1983, 1982, 1989, 1980, 1985};
    int n = sizeof(years) / sizeof(years[0]);
    qsort(years, n, sizeof(int), compare_ints);

    printf("Sorted: ");
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        printf("%d ", years[i]);
    printf("\n");

    // Pointer ownership: strdup allocates, you must free
    char *copy = strdup("Master of Puppets");
    printf("strdup: '%s'\n", copy);
    free(copy);

    // goto cleanup pattern
    printf("Demonstrating goto cleanup...\n");
    char *buf = malloc(100);
    if (!buf) return 1;

    char *msg = malloc(50);
    if (!msg) goto free_buf;

    snprintf(buf, 100, "Resource 1 OK");
    snprintf(msg, 50, "Resource 2 OK");
    printf("  %s, %s\n", buf, msg);

    free(msg);
free_buf:
    free(buf);

    return 0;
}
```

## Key Points

- `exit` terminates the program from any function. Use it for unrecoverable
  errors.
- `exit` flushes `stdio` streams and calls `atexit` handlers before
  terminating.
- `extern "C"` tells the C++ compiler not to mangle function names, so it can
  link to C libraries.
- C headers often use `#ifdef __cplusplus` to wrap declarations in
  `extern "C"` automatically.
- When you receive a pointer from a function, always determine who owns the
  memory: you, the function, or a library.
- C has no exceptions. Use return codes for errors and `goto` cleanup for
  releasing resources in the correct order.
- `qsort` is the most common use of function pointers — it takes a comparison
  callback to sort any type.

## Exercises

1. **Think about it:** In C++ you would use exceptions for error handling. In C
   there are no exceptions. What strategies can you use to handle errors in
   deeply nested function calls? When is `exit` appropriate and when is it not?

2. **What happens here?**

    ```c
    #include <stdlib.h>
    #include <stdio.h>

    void cleanup(void) {
        printf("Adios!\n");
    }

    int main(void) {
        atexit(cleanup);
        printf("Starting...\n");
        exit(0);
    }
    ```

3. **Where is the bug?**

    ```c
    char *get_greeting(void) {
        char buf[50];
        sprintf(buf, "Hola, mundo");
        return buf;
    }
    ```

4. **Think about it:** You call a function `char *get_name(int id)` from a
   library. How would you determine whether you need to `free` the returned
   pointer?

5. **Where is the bug?** (Hint: ownership)

    ```c
    char *name = strdup("Walking on Sunshine");
    char *alias = name;
    free(name);
    printf("%s\n", alias);
    ```

6. **Calculation:** Given `int nums[] = {5, 10, 15, 20};`, what is the value of
   `sizeof(nums) / sizeof(nums[0])`?

7. **What does this print?**

    ```c
    int compare_desc(const void *a, const void *b) {
        int ia = *(const int *)a;
        int ib = *(const int *)b;
        return (ib > ia) - (ib < ia);
    }

    int main(void) {
        int vals[] = {3, 1, 4, 1, 5};
        qsort(vals, 5, sizeof(int), compare_desc);
        printf("%d %d %d %d %d\n", vals[0], vals[1], vals[2], vals[3], vals[4]);
        return 0;
    }
    ```

8. **Write a program** that uses `qsort` to sort an array of strings in
   reverse alphabetical order. Write a custom comparison function that calls
   `strcmp` with the arguments swapped.

9. **Write a program** in C++ that uses `extern "C"` to call the C function
   `strlen` from `<string.h>`, passes it a string, and prints the result.
   Compile it with `c++` to verify it works.

# Conclusion

You have covered a lot of ground — from `printf` format specifiers to file
descriptors to pointer ownership. Here are the key takeaways:

- **C and C++ are different languages.** Modern C++ has evolved far from C.
  Knowing one does not mean you automatically know the other.
- **`printf` and `scanf` replace `iostream`.** Format specifiers must match
  argument types. `scanf` needs `&` for scalar variables.
- **C types are explicit.** No `auto`, no `std::string`, no classes. You have
  basic types, `typedef`, arrays, and `struct`.
- **C shares most operators with C++** but there is no operator overloading,
  `<<` and `>>` are strictly bitwise, and boolean results are plain `int`.
- **Control flow is nearly identical to C++** except there are no range-based
  `for` loops and `goto` is an accepted idiom for cleanup.
- **Pointers hold memory addresses.** Use `&` to get an address, `*` to follow
  one, and `->` to access struct fields through a pointer. Arrays decay to
  pointers, and pointer arithmetic moves in units of the pointed-to type.
- **All function arguments are pass by value.** To modify a caller's variable,
  pass a pointer to it. Use `const` parameters to document read-only intent.
- **Know where your memory lives.** Global variables last the whole program,
  local variables live on the stack, and dynamic memory from `malloc` lives on
  the heap until you `free` it.
- **Strings in C are `char` arrays** terminated by `'\0'`. You must manage
  buffer sizes manually and use functions like `strlen`, `strcpy`, `strcmp`, and
  `strcat` instead of `std::string` methods.
- **`stdio` provides buffered I/O** through `FILE *` pointers. Low-level I/O
  uses file descriptors and system calls like `read`, `write`, and `open`.
- **C has no exceptions.** Use return codes for errors and `goto` cleanup to
  release resources in reverse order.
- **Function pointers replace lambdas.** `qsort` is the classic example —
  pass a comparison function to sort any type.
- **`exit` terminates from anywhere.** Use it for fatal errors. `extern "C"`
  bridges C and C++. Always know who owns a pointer.

Es un mundo nuevo, but you have the C++ foundation to build on. The syntax will
feel familiar even when the idioms are different. Write small programs, compile
them with `cc`, and get comfortable with the compiler's warnings — they are
your best amigo.

Buena suerte — you have got this.

# Appendix A: Macros

In C++, you have `constexpr` for compile-time constants, templates for generic
code, and `inline` functions to avoid call overhead. C has none of those.
Instead, C leans heavily on the **preprocessor** — the `#define` macro system
that rewrites your source code *before* the compiler sees it.

Macros are pure textual substitution. The preprocessor does not know about
types, scope, or expressions — it just replaces text. This makes macros
powerful and flexible, but also a source of subtle bugs if you are not careful.

## Object-Like Macros

\index{macro!object-like}
\index{\#define}

The simplest macros define named constants:

```c
#define MAX_BUF   1024
#define PI        3.14159265
#define GREETING  "Hola, amigo"
```

Everywhere the preprocessor sees `MAX_BUF`, it replaces it with `1024`. No
semicolons — a common mistake is writing `#define MAX_BUF 1024;`, which would
paste `1024;` everywhere, breaking expressions like `malloc(MAX_BUF * sizeof(int))`.

::: {.tip}
**Trap:** Do not put a semicolon at the end of a `#define`. The semicolon
becomes part of the replacement text and will cause surprising errors.
:::

### Conditional Compilation

\index{conditional compilation}

Macros also control which code the compiler sees:

```c
#define DEBUG

#ifdef DEBUG
    printf("x = %d\n", x);
#endif
```

`#ifdef` checks whether a macro is defined (regardless of its value). Its
complement `#ifndef` checks that a macro is *not* defined. You can also use
`#if`, `#elif`, and `#else` for more complex conditions:

```c
#if VERBOSE_LEVEL >= 2
    printf("Detailed trace...\n");
#elif VERBOSE_LEVEL == 1
    printf("Basic trace...\n");
#else
    /* no tracing */
#endif
```

### Include Guards

\index{include guard}

The most common use of `#ifndef` is protecting header files from being included
more than once:

```c
/* myheader.h */
#ifndef MYHEADER_H
#define MYHEADER_H

struct point {
    int x, y;
};

void draw_point(struct point p);

#endif /* MYHEADER_H */
```

The first time `myheader.h` is included, `MYHEADER_H` is not defined, so the
contents are processed and `MYHEADER_H` gets defined. Any subsequent include
finds `MYHEADER_H` already defined and skips the entire file.

::: {.tip}
**Tip:** Many compilers support `#pragma once` as a non-standard alternative to
include guards. It is simpler to write but not portable to all compilers. When
in doubt, use the `#ifndef` guard — it works everywhere.
:::

## Function-Like Macros

\index{macro!function-like}

Macros can take parameters, making them look like functions:

```c
#define SQUARE(x)   ((x) * (x))
#define MAX(a, b)   ((a) > (b) ? (a) : (b))
#define ABS(x)      ((x) < 0 ? -(x) : (x))
```

But they are *not* functions — they are text substitution with parameter
placeholders. This distinction matters.

### The Parenthesization Rules

Always parenthesize every parameter use *and* the entire macro body:

```c
/* Wrong: */
#define SQUARE(x) x * x

/* SQUARE(1 + 2) expands to: 1 + 2 * 1 + 2 = 5 (not 9!) */

/* Right: */
#define SQUARE(x) ((x) * (x))

/* SQUARE(1 + 2) expands to: ((1 + 2) * (1 + 2)) = 9 */
```

Without parentheses, operator precedence in the surrounding expression can
silently rearrange the computation.

### The Double-Evaluation Trap

Since macros substitute text, each parameter reference evaluates the argument
again:

```c
#define SQUARE(x) ((x) * (x))

int i = 3;
int result = SQUARE(i++);
/* Expands to: ((i++) * (i++)) — i is incremented TWICE */
/* Undefined behavior: two unsequenced modifications of i */
```

A real function evaluates its argument once. A macro evaluates it once per
appearance in the replacement text. This is the most important difference
between macros and functions.

::: {.tip}
**Trap:** Never pass expressions with side effects (like `i++`, `f()`, or
assignment) to function-like macros. The expression will be evaluated multiple
times, producing unexpected results or undefined behavior.
:::

### Multi-Statement Macros: `do { ... } while (0)`

If a macro needs to execute multiple statements, wrap them in
`do { ... } while (0)`:

```c
#define SWAP(a, b) do { \
    int tmp = (a);      \
    (a) = (b);          \
    (b) = tmp;          \
} while (0)
```

Why not just use braces? Consider:

```c
if (x > y)
    SWAP(x, y);
else
    printf("Already sorted\n");
```

If `SWAP` expanded to a bare `{ ... }`, the semicolon after `SWAP(x, y)` would
terminate the `if` statement, and the `else` would become a syntax error. The
`do { ... } while (0)` idiom creates a single statement that works correctly
with semicolons and control flow.

::: {.tip}
**Tip:** The `do { ... } while (0)` pattern is everywhere in C codebases. It
looks odd at first, but it is the standard way to make multi-statement macros
behave like ordinary statements.
:::

## Stringification and Token Pasting

\index{stringification}
\index{token pasting}

The preprocessor has two special operators for macro arguments.

### Stringification: `#`

The `#` operator turns a macro argument into a string literal:

```c
#define PRINT_VAR(x) printf(#x " = %d\n", x)

int score = 42;
PRINT_VAR(score);
/* Expands to: printf("score" " = %d\n", score); */
/* Adjacent string literals are concatenated: "score = %d\n" */
/* Output: score = 42 */
```

This is useful for debug macros where you want to print both the variable name
and its value.

### Token Pasting: `##`

The `##` operator joins two tokens into one:

```c
#define DECLARE_PAIR(type) \
    type type##_first;     \
    type type##_second;

DECLARE_PAIR(int)
/* Expands to:
   int int_first;
   int int_second;
*/
```

Token pasting is commonly used to generate families of related variables or
functions from a single macro.

## Variadic Macros

\index{variadic macro}
\index{\_\_VA\_ARGS\_\_}

Macros can accept a variable number of arguments using `...` and `__VA_ARGS__`:

```c
#define LOG(fmt, ...) fprintf(stderr, "[LOG] " fmt "\n", __VA_ARGS__)

LOG("score is %d", 42);
/* Expands to: fprintf(stderr, "[LOG] " "score is %d" "\n", 42); */
```

This is commonly used to wrap `printf`-style functions with extra decoration
like timestamps or log levels.

::: {.tip}
**Tip:** When `__VA_ARGS__` is empty, the trailing comma before it can cause a
compilation error. GNU C provides `##__VA_ARGS__` which swallows the comma when
the argument list is empty:

```c
#define LOG(fmt, ...) fprintf(stderr, "[LOG] " fmt "\n", ##__VA_ARGS__)
LOG("started");  /* No extra args — comma is removed */
```

This is a GCC/Clang extension. C23 standardizes this behavior with
`__VA_OPT__`.

## Multi-Level Expansion

Macros can expand to other macros, and the preprocessor **rescans** the result
to expand again. But the `#` and `##` operators are special — they operate on
the raw argument text *before* any expansion happens.

```c
#define MAX_BUF 1024
#define STRINGIFY(x)  #x
#define XSTRINGIFY(x) STRINGIFY(x)

printf("%s\n", STRINGIFY(MAX_BUF));
/* # operates before expansion: prints "MAX_BUF" */

printf("%s\n", XSTRINGIFY(MAX_BUF));
/* First pass: XSTRINGIFY(MAX_BUF) → STRINGIFY(1024) */
/* Rescan:     STRINGIFY(1024) → "1024" */
/* Prints "1024" */
```

`STRINGIFY(MAX_BUF)` gives `"MAX_BUF"` because `#` stringifies its argument
before expansion. `XSTRINGIFY(MAX_BUF)` first expands `MAX_BUF` to `1024`
(since the outer macro does not use `#` directly), then passes `1024` to
`STRINGIFY`, producing `"1024"`.

This two-level indirect pattern is used whenever you need the *expanded* value
of a macro as a string.

**Tip:** Whenever you need a macro's expanded value as a string, use the
two-level indirect pattern. It comes up often when embedding version numbers
or configuration values in strings.

## X-Macros

\index{X-macro}

X-macros are a technique for defining a list of items once and expanding it in
multiple ways. The idea: define the list as a macro that calls an unspecified
"action" macro on each item, then define that action differently for each use.

Here is a concrete example that generates both an enum and a string table from
a single list of log levels:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

/* Define the list once */
#define LOG_LEVELS(X) \
    X(LOG_DEBUG)      \
    X(LOG_INFO)       \
    X(LOG_WARN)       \
    X(LOG_ERROR)      \
    X(LOG_FATAL)

/* Generate the enum */
#define AS_ENUM(name) name,
enum log_level { LOG_LEVELS(AS_ENUM) LOG_COUNT };

/* Generate the string table */
#define AS_STRING(name) #name,
const char *log_level_names[] = { LOG_LEVELS(AS_STRING) };

int main(void) {
    for (int i = 0; i < LOG_COUNT; i++) {
        printf("%d = %s\n", i, log_level_names[i]);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Output:

```
0 = LOG_DEBUG
1 = LOG_INFO
2 = LOG_WARN
3 = LOG_ERROR
4 = LOG_FATAL
```

Add a new log level? Add one line to `LOG_LEVELS` and the enum and string
table stay in sync automatically. Without X-macros, you would need to update
both the enum and the string array separately — and hope you never forget one.

::: {.tip}
**Tip:** X-macros are one of the preprocessor's most powerful patterns. You
will see them in real codebases for error codes, command tables, and state
machines. The key advantage: a single source of truth for a list of items.

## Try It: Macro Starter

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// Object-like macros
#define MAX_TRACKS  10
#define LABEL       "Sire Records"

// Function-like macro with proper parenthesization
#define SQUARE(x)   ((x) * (x))
#define MAX(a, b)   ((a) > (b) ? (a) : (b))

// Stringification: print variable name and value
#define PRINT_INT(var) printf(#var " = %d\n", var)

// Multi-statement macro using do { ... } while (0)
#define SWAP(a, b) do { \
    int tmp = (a);      \
    (a) = (b);          \
    (b) = tmp;          \
} while (0)

// Variadic macro
#define LOG(fmt, ...) fprintf(stderr, "[LOG] " fmt "\n", ##__VA_ARGS__)

int main(void) {
    // Object-like
    printf("Label: %s, Max tracks: %d\n", LABEL, MAX_TRACKS);

    // Function-like
    printf("SQUARE(5) = %d\n", SQUARE(5));
    printf("SQUARE(1+2) = %d\n", SQUARE(1 + 2));
    printf("MAX(3, 7) = %d\n", MAX(3, 7));

    // Stringification
    int year = 1984;
    PRINT_INT(year);

    // SWAP
    int a = 10, b = 20;
    printf("Before swap: a=%d, b=%d\n", a, b);
    SWAP(a, b);
    printf("After swap:  a=%d, b=%d\n", a, b);

    // Conditional compilation
#ifdef DEBUG
    printf("Debug mode is on\n");
#else
    printf("Debug mode is off\n");
#endif

    // Variadic macro
    LOG("started");
    LOG("year is %d", 1985);

    return 0;
}
```

## Key Points

- Macros are **textual substitution** performed before compilation. They are
  not functions and do not respect scope or type rules.
- Object-like macros define constants and feature flags. Never end a `#define`
  with a semicolon.
- Function-like macros must have every parameter use and the entire body
  parenthesized to avoid precedence bugs.
- Macro arguments are evaluated each time they appear — do not pass expressions
  with side effects.
- Use `do { ... } while (0)` for multi-statement macros so they work correctly
  with `if`/`else` and semicolons.
- The `#` operator stringifies a macro argument; `##` pastes tokens together.
- `#` and `##` prevent argument expansion. Use the two-level indirect pattern
  (e.g., `XSTRINGIFY`/`STRINGIFY`) when you need the expanded value.
- `__VA_ARGS__` enables variadic macros for wrapping `printf`-style functions.
- X-macros define a list once and expand it multiple ways, keeping enums and
  string tables in sync.

## Exercises

1. **Think about it:** C++ uses `constexpr` and `inline` functions to replace
   many uses of macros. What specific problems do macros have that these C++
   features solve? Why does C still rely on macros despite these problems?

2. **What does this produce?**

    ```c
    #define DOUBLE(x) ((x) + (x))

    int i = 5;
    printf("%d\n", DOUBLE(i++));
    ```

3. **Calculation:** Given the macro `#define BUFSIZE 256`, how many bytes does
   `char buf[BUFSIZE + 1]` allocate? Why is the `+ 1` a common pattern?

4. **Where is the bug?**

    ```c
    #define MUL(a, b)  a * b

    int result = MUL(2 + 3, 4 + 5);
    printf("%d\n", result);
    ```

5. **What does this produce?**

    ```c
    #define STRINGIFY(x)  #x
    #define XSTRINGIFY(x) STRINGIFY(x)
    #define VERSION 3

    printf("[%s] [%s]\n", STRINGIFY(VERSION), XSTRINGIFY(VERSION));
    ```

6. **Where is the bug?**

    ```c
    #define LOG_IF(cond, msg) \
        if (cond) \
            printf("[WARN] %s\n", msg);

    if (x > 100)
        LOG_IF(x > 200, "very high");
    else
        printf("normal\n");
    ```

7. **Write a program** that defines an X-macro list of at least four colors,
   then uses it to generate both an `enum` and a function that returns the
   string name for a given enum value. Print each color's enum value and name.
