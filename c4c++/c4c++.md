# 0. How to read this booklet

This is a short booklet to help a C++ programmer get up to speed with C.
As a side benefit, you will probably find that you understand C++ better at the end of it.

Each chapter is meant to help you understand a topic, but you will still want to reference API descriptions for more specifics of the parameters and operating conditions.
Hopefully, you'll have the context you need to understand API documentation.

## Tips

**Tips** call out details that you need to pay special attention to.
**Traps** warn you of common mistakes made.
**Wut** calls out a detail that is counter-intuitive, so make sure you pay attention.

## Try It

As the intro to the most amazing programming language book ever written starts out:

> The only way to learn a new programming language is by writing programs in it.

You need to write some code.
Make sure you try writing some programs from scratch.
At the end of most sections is a starter program that you can type in and modify to play with.
Don't use it as an excuse to avoid writing some of your own starter programs.
It's the only way to master a language.

## Exercises

Don't skip the exercises at the end of the chapters.
You can get the answer key, but don't look at the answer key before you work out the answer yourself.
If you look at the answer key first, the concepts will not sink in.

# 1. Introduction

In the beginning, knowing C++ automatically meant you knew C. The original C++
compiler, `cfront`, literally translated C++ code into C before compiling it.
But modern C++ has diverged dramatically from C. You have `std::string`,
`std::vector`, smart pointers, RAII, templates, `iostream`, and exceptions — none
of which exist in C. If someone hands you a C codebase today, your modern C++
instincts will not get you very far.

So why learn C? Because C is everywhere. Operating systems, embedded firmware,
database engines, language runtimes — the foundational software that the world
runs on is written in C. Even if you spend most of your career in C++, you will
encounter C code, C libraries, and C APIs. Understanding C makes you a better
programmer, period.

My go-to C textbook is *The C Programming Language (Second Edition)* by Brian
Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie — often called "K&R." It is one of the most
influential programming books ever written, and it opens like this:

> ## Getting Started
>
> The only way to learn a new programming language is by writing programs in it.
> The first program to write is the same for all languages: Print the words
> hello, world. This is the big hurdle; to leap over it you have to be able to
> create the program text somewhere, compile it successfully, load it, run it,
> and find out where your output went. With these mechanical details mastered,

> #include <stdio.h>
> main()
> {
>     printf("hello, world\n");
> }
> ```
>
> Just how to run this program depends on the system you are using. As a
> specific example, on the UNIX operating system you must create the program in
> a file whose name ends in ".c", such as hello.c, then compile it with the
> command `cc hello.c`. If you haven't botched anything, such as omitting a
> character or misspelling something, the compilation will proceed silently, and
> make an executable file called a.out. If you run a.out by typing the command
> `a.out`, it will print `hello, world`. On other systems, the rules will be
> different; check with a local expert.

## Differences Summary

\index{stdio.h}
Notice the differences from C++. There is no `#include <iostream>`, no
`std::println`, no `std::cout`. In C, you use `printf` from `<stdio.h>` for
output. The file ends in `.c`, not `.cpp`. You compile with `cc` (the C
compiler) rather than `c++`.

Here is a quick summary of the biggest differences you will encounter:

| C++ | C |
|:---|:---|
| `std::string` | `char` arrays with `'\0'` |
| `std::vector` | raw arrays or `malloc` |
| `std::cout` / `std::println` | `printf` |
| `std::cin` | `scanf` |
| `new` / `delete` | `malloc` / `free` |
| Smart pointers | Raw pointers (only option) |
| Classes and objects | Structs and functions |
| References (`&`) | Pointers (`*`) |
| `bool` (built-in) | `_Bool` or `#include <stdbool.h>` |
| `// comments` | `/* comments */` (C89); `//` allowed since C99 |

::: {.tip}
\index{cc (compiler)}
**Tip:** C source files use the `.c` extension and are compiled with `cc`. If
you accidentally compile a `.c` file with `c++`, it will be treated as C++ and
may accept syntax that real C compilers reject. Always use `cc` when writing C.
:::

\index{printf}
## Printing with `printf`

```c
int printf(const char *format, ...);
```

In C++, you use `std::cout` or `std::println` for output. In C, you use
`printf` from `<stdio.h>`. Unlike `std::println`, `printf` does not
automatically add a newline at the end of the output. If you want each call to
end on its own line, you must include `\n` in the format string yourself.

The first argument to `printf` is a **format string** containing literal text
and **format specifiers** that start with `%`. Each specifier is replaced by the
corresponding argument that follows:

```c
int year = 1984;
printf("Year: %d\n", year);   // Year: 1984
```

\index{format specifier}
Here are the format specifiers you will use most:

| Specifier | Type | Example | Output |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| `%d` | `int` (decimal) | `printf("%d", 42)` | `42` |
| `%x` | `int` (hex, lowercase) | `printf("%x", 255)` | `ff` |
| `%X` | `int` (hex, uppercase) | `printf("%X", 255)` | `FF` |
| `%f` | `double` | `printf("%f", 3.14)` | `3.140000` |
| `%e` | `double` (scientific) | `printf("%e", 3.14)` | `3.140000e+00` |
| `%c` | `char` | `printf("%c", 'A')` | `A` |
| `%s` | `char *` (string) | `printf("%s", "hola")` | `hola` |
| `%p` | pointer | `printf("%p", (void *)ptr)` | `0x7ffd...` |
| `%zu` | `size_t` | `printf("%zu", sizeof(int))` | `4` |

::: {.tip}
**Trap:** The first argument to `printf` should always be a string literal.
Never pass a variable as the first argument.
It may work, but it is a potential security vulnerability (format string attack).
If you only want to print a string variable, don't do ~~`printf(str)`~~, do `printf("%s", str)`.
:::

You can control the width and precision of output by placing numbers between the
`%` and the specifier letter. A number before the specifier sets the minimum
field width, and a `.` followed by a number sets the precision (decimal places
for floats, max characters for strings):

```c
double score = 98.6;
printf("Score: %f\n", score);      // 98.600000  (default: 6 decimal places)
printf("Score: %.2f\n", score);    // 98.60      (2 decimal places)
printf("Score: %e\n", score);      // 9.860000e+01 (scientific notation)
```

**Zero-filled output** is useful for track numbers, timestamps, and hex
addresses. Place a `0` before the width to pad with zeros instead of spaces:

```c
for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    printf("Track %02d\n", i);
}
// Track 01
// Track 02
// Track 03
// Track 04
// Track 05

int color = 0xFF8800;
printf("Color: 0x%06X\n", color);   // Color: 0xFF8800

int score = 95;
printf("Score: %d%%\n", score);      // Score: 95%
```

**Since `%` introduces a format specifier, you must write `%%` to print a literal
percent sign.**

::: {.tip}
**Trap:** `printf` does not check that your format specifiers match the types of
your arguments. If you write `printf("%d", 3.14)`, the compiler may warn you,
but it will not stop you. The result is garbage. Always match specifiers to
types: `%d` for `int`, `%f` for `double`, `%s` for `char *`, and so on.
:::

## Try It: printf Starter

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    // Basic format specifiers
    printf("Integer: %d\n", 1984);
    printf("Hex:     %x (lowercase)  %X (uppercase)\n", 255, 255);
    printf("Float:   %f\n", 3.14);
    printf("Sci:     %e\n", 3.14);
    printf("Char:    %c\n", 'A');
    printf("String:  %s\n", "Hola");

    // Width and precision
    printf("\nFormatted output:\n");
    for (int i = 1; i <= 3; i++)
        printf("  Track %02d\n", i);

    printf("  Pi: %.2f\n", 3.14159);
    printf("  100%% complete\n");

    return 0;
}
```

## Key Points

- C uses `printf` from `<stdio.h>` for output — there is no `std::cout` or
  `std::println`.
- Format specifiers (`%d`, `%s`, `%f`, etc.) must match the types of the
  arguments passed to `printf`.
- C source files end in `.c` and are compiled with `cc`, not `c++`.
- C has no classes, no templates, no exceptions, no smart pointers, and no
  `std::string`.
- `printf` does not add a newline automatically — you must include `\n`
  yourself.

## Exercises

1. **Think about it:** C uses format specifiers in `printf` while C++ uses
   `operator<<` or `std::format`. What advantage does the format string
   approach give you when writing output to a log file? What is a disadvantage?

2. **What does this print?**

    ```c
    printf("%05d %x\n", 42, 255);
    ```

3. **Calculation:** How many bytes does the string literal `"hello"` occupy in
   memory?

4. **Where is the bug?**

    ```c
    double pi = 3.14159;
    printf("Pi is %d\n", pi);
    ```

5. **Write a program** that prints a 5x5 multiplication table using `printf`
   with width formatting so the columns are aligned.

# 2. Pointers

If you have been writing modern C++, you may have rarely (or never) used raw
pointers. Smart pointers like `std::unique_ptr` and `std::shared_ptr` manage
memory for you. References let you pass objects without copying them. The
standard library hides pointer details behind iterators and containers.

In C, none of that exists. Pointers are everywhere, and you must be comfortable
with them. Every dynamic data structure, every function that needs to modify its
arguments, every interaction with the operating system — all involve pointers.

\index{pointer}
## What Is a Pointer?

A pointer is a variable that holds a memory address. That's it. Instead of
holding a value like `42`, a pointer holds the *location* where `42` is stored.

## Declaring Pointers

A pointer type is declared by placing a `*` after the base type. The type before
the `*` tells you what kind of data lives at the address the pointer holds:

```c
int *p;         // p is a pointer to an int
char *s;        // s is a pointer to a char
double *d;      // d is a pointer to a double
```

::: {.tip}
**Trap:** The `*` belongs to the variable, not the type. This declaration creates
one pointer and one regular int:

```c
int *p, q;    // p is a pointer to int; q is just an int
```

To declare two pointers, you need two stars: `int *p, *q;`
:::

\index{address-of operator (\&)}
## The Address-Of Operator: `&`

The `&` operator returns the address of a variable. You have seen `&` in C++ for
references — in C, it is strictly the address-of operator:

```c
int score = 100;
int *p = &score;   // p now holds the address of score

printf("score = %d\n", score);    // 100
printf("address of score = %p\n", (void *)p);  // something like 0x7ffd5e8a3b2c
```

\index{dereference operator (*)}
## Dereferencing: `*`

The `*` operator on a pointer gives you the value at the address the pointer
holds. This is called **dereferencing**:

```c
int score = 100;
int *p = &score;

printf("Value at p: %d\n", *p);   // 100

*p = 200;                          // modify score through the pointer
printf("score is now: %d\n", score);  // 200
```

Notice the dual use of `*`: in a declaration, it means "this is a pointer." In
an expression, it means "follow the pointer to the value."

\index{pointer!to pointer}
## Pointers to Pointers

Since a pointer is just a variable, it has an address too. You can create a
pointer to a pointer:

```c
int val = 42;
int *p = &val;       // p points to val
int **pp = &p;       // pp points to p

printf("val = %d\n", val);       // 42
printf("*p = %d\n", *p);        // 42
printf("**pp = %d\n", **pp);    // 42
```

You dereference `pp` twice: once to get `p`, and again to get `val`. Pointers to
pointers show up frequently in C — for example, `main` can be declared as
`int main(int argc, char **argv)`, where `argv` is a pointer to an array of
string pointers.

## Visualizing Pointers in Memory

Consider this small program:

```c
int x = 1985;
int y = 80;
int *p = &x;
int **pp = &p;
```

Every variable lives at some address in memory. Here is what the layout looks
like (using made-up but realistic addresses):

```
  Variable    Address      Value
  --------    ----------   ----------
  x           0x1000       1985
  y           0x1004       80
  p           0x1008       0x1000  -------> x
  pp          0x1010       0x1008  -------> p -------> x
```

The variable `x` lives at address `0x1000` and holds the value `1985`. The
pointer `p` lives at address `0x1008` and holds the value `0x1000` — the address
of `x`. The pointer-to-pointer `pp` lives at `0x1010` and holds `0x1008` — the
address of `p`. Following the chain: `*pp` gives you `p` (which is `0x1000`),
and `**pp` gives you `x` (which is `1985`).

Notice that `p` and `pp` are just variables that hold numbers. Those numbers
happen to be memory addresses. There is nothing magical about a pointer — it is
just a variable whose value is an address.

::: {.tip}
**Tip:** You can take the address of any variable with `&`, including the
address of a pointer variable. The expression `&p` gives you the address where
`p` itself is stored, not the address `p` points to.
:::

\index{NULL}
## NULL Pointers

A pointer that does not point to anything should be set to `NULL`:

```c
int *p = NULL;   // p points to nothing

if (p != NULL) {
    printf("Value: %d\n", *p);
} else {
    printf("Pointer is NULL\n");
}
```

Dereferencing a `NULL` pointer is undefined behavior and usually crashes your
program with a segmentation fault. Always check before dereferencing a pointer
you did not initialize yourself.

::: {.tip}
**Tip:** In C, `NULL` is typically defined as `((void *)0)`. You may also see
`0` used directly. C++11 introduced `nullptr` as a type-safe null pointer — C
does not have `nullptr`, so use `NULL`.
:::

## Pointers and Arrays

A pointer might point to a single value in memory, or it might point to the
first element of an array of values. There is nothing in the type system that
tells you which — an `int *` looks the same either way:

```c
int score = 100;
int *p = &score;              // points to one int

int nums[] = {10, 20, 30};
int *q = nums;                // points to the first of three ints
```

Both `p` and `q` are `int *`. The compiler does not know whether there are more
`int` values after the one being pointed to. It is up to you, the programmer, to
keep track of how many elements a pointer refers to and to stay within bounds.

\index{array!decay to pointer}
In C, arrays and pointers are intimately connected. When you use an array name
in most expressions, it **decays** to a pointer to the first element. ("Decays" is the technical term — the array loses its size information and becomes a plain pointer.)

```c
int nums[] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
int *p = nums;       // p points to nums[0]; no & needed

printf("%d\n", *p);       // 10 (same as nums[0])
printf("%d\n", *(p + 1)); // 20 (same as nums[1])
printf("%d\n", p[2]);     // 30 — yes, you can use [] on pointers!
```

Another way to see the decay in action is to notice that the expressions `nums` and `&nums` produce the same address.

```c
int nums[] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
printf("%p %p\n", (void *)nums, (void *)&nums);  // same address printed twice
```

\index{pointer!arithmetic}
**Pointer arithmetic** works in units of the pointed-to type. If `p` is an
`int *` and `int` is 4 bytes, then `p + 1` advances the address by 4 bytes to
the next `int`. You never have to think about byte sizes — the compiler handles
it.

```c
int nums[] = {10, 20, 30};
int *p = nums;

for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    printf("nums[%d] = %d\n", i, *(p + i));
}
```

::: {.tip}
**Tip:** Array indexing `nums[i]` is actually syntactic sugar for `*(nums + i)`.
This is why `2[nums]` technically works — it is `*(2 + nums)`, which is the same
thing. Don't write code like that, but knowing this helps you understand how
arrays and pointers relate.
:::

\index{struct}
## Pointers and Structures

In C, you use `struct` to group related data — much like a class with only
public data members in C++. Pointers to structures are extremely common; almost
any non-trivial C program passes struct pointers around.

```c
struct song {
    char title[40];
    int year;
};

struct song track = {"Karma Chameleon", 1983};
struct song *p = &track;
```

When a structure is stored in memory, all of its members will be stored in the same chunk of memory.
For example, if you look at the memory where `track` is stored, you will see 40 bytes reserved for the title and four bytes (on most systems) reserved for the year.
The layout can include padding to make memory access more efficient.
For example, if title were only 39 bytes there may still be a byte between the `title` and `year` to make `year`'s memory address 4-byte aligned.

You can access members of a structure directly using the `.` operator:

```c
printf("Title: %s\n", track.title);
printf("Year: %d\n", track.year);
```

To access a field through a pointer, you must dereference the pointer first.
But the `.` operator has higher precedence than `*`, so you need parentheses:

```c
printf("Title: %s\n", (*p).title);   // parentheses required
printf("Year: %d\n", (*p).year);
```

\index{arrow operator (->)}
Writing `(*p).field` everywhere is tedious. C provides the `->` operator as a
convenient shorthand:

```c
printf("Title: %s\n", p->title);     // same as (*p).title
printf("Year: %d\n", p->year);       // same as (*p).year
```

::: {.tip}
**Tip:** The `->` operator is simply `(*p).field` written more clearly. You
will see `->` far more often than `(*p).` in real C code. If you have a
pointer to a struct, reach for `->`.
:::

\index{pass by value}
## Pass by Value (and Pointers as a Workaround)

In C++, you can pass arguments by reference using `&`:

```cpp
void increment(int &x) { x++; }   // C++ — modifies the original
```

C does not have references. **All function parameters in C are pass by value** —
the function receives a copy of the argument, not the original. If you want a
function to modify a variable in the caller, you pass a *pointer* to it:

```c
void increment(int *x) {
    (*x)++;   // dereference the pointer, then increment
}

int main(void) {
    int score = 99;
    increment(&score);      // pass the ADDRESS of score
    printf("%d\n", score);  // 100
    return 0;
}
```

The function `increment` receives a *copy* of the pointer (the address), but
since both the original and the copy point to the same memory, dereferencing
either one reaches the same variable. This is how C simulates pass by reference.

::: {.tip}
**Tip:** Every time you see a function parameter with `*` in C, ask yourself:
"Is this pointer here so the function can modify the caller's variable, or
because it needs to access a block of memory (like an array)?" Often it is
both.
:::

## Try It: Pointer Starter

This program demonstrates the core pointer operations:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void swap(int *a, int *b) {
    int temp = *a;
    *a = *b;
    *b = temp;
}

int main(void) {
    // Basic pointer usage
    int val = 1985;
    int *p = &val;
    printf("val = %d, *p = %d\n", val, *p);
    printf("Address of val: %p\n", (void *)&val);

    // Modify through pointer
    *p = 1989;
    printf("After *p = 1989: val = %d\n", val);

    // Pointer to pointer
    int **pp = &p;
    printf("**pp = %d\n", **pp);

    // Pass by value with pointers
    int x = 10, y = 20;
    printf("Before swap: x=%d, y=%d\n", x, y);
    swap(&x, &y);
    printf("After swap:  x=%d, y=%d\n", x, y);

    // Arrays and pointers
    char *words[] = {"Totally", "Radical", "Tubular"};
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        printf("words[%d] = %s\n", i, words[i]);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

## Key Points

- A pointer holds a memory address. Use `&` to get an address and `*` to
  dereference it.
- All pointers are the same size on a given system, regardless of the type they
  point to.
- Arrays decay to pointers in most expressions. `a[i]` is equivalent to
  `*(a + i)`.
- Pointer arithmetic moves in units of the pointed-to type, not bytes.
- Use `->` to access struct fields through a pointer. It is shorthand for
  `(*p).field`.
- All function parameters in C are pass by value. Pass a pointer to modify the
  caller's variable.

## Exercises

1. **Think about it:** In C++, you can pass by reference to modify a caller's
   variable. Why do you think C was designed with only pass by value? What does
   this simplify in the language?

2. **What does this print?**

    ```c
    int a[] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
    int *p = a + 2;
    printf("%d %d %d\n", *p, *(p - 1), p[1]);
    ```

3. **Calculation:** On a 64-bit system, what is `sizeof(int *)`,
   `sizeof(char *)`, and `sizeof(double *)`?

4. **Where is the bug?**

    ```c
    int *get_value(void) {
        int result = 42;
        return &result;
    }
    ```

5. **What does this print?**

    ```c
    int x = 10;
    int *p = &x;
    int **pp = &p;
    **pp = 20;
    printf("%d\n", x);
    ```

6. **Where is the bug?**

    ```c
    struct song {
        char title[40];
        int year;
    };

    struct song *p = NULL;
    printf("%s\n", p->title);
    ```

7. **Write a program** that declares an array of 5 integers, uses a pointer to
   iterate through the array, and prints each element along with its memory
   address.

# 3. Allocating Memory

Every variable in your program lives somewhere in memory, but not all memory is
created equal. Understanding where variables live — and how long they last — is
essential for writing correct C programs.

\index{global variable}
## Global Variables

A **global variable** is declared outside of any function. It is created when the
program starts and exists until the program exits:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int high_score = 0;   // global — lives for the entire program

void update_score(int points) {
    if (points > high_score) {
        high_score = points;
    }
}

int main(void) {
    update_score(1000);
    update_score(500);
    printf("High score: %d\n", high_score);  // 1000
    return 0;
}
```

Global variables are visible to every function in the file. They are convenient
but can make programs harder to reason about, since any function can change them.

::: {.tip}
**Tip:** Use global variables sparingly. When every function can read and write
the same variable, bugs become harder to track down. Prefer passing data through
function parameters.
:::

\index{local variable}
## Local Variables

A **local variable** is declared inside a function (or block). It is created when
the function is called and destroyed when the function returns:

```c
void greet(void) {
    char message[] = "Hola, amigo";  // local — exists only during greet()
    printf("%s\n", message);
}
// message is gone once greet() returns
```

\index{stack}
Local variables live on the **stack** — a region of memory that grows and shrinks
automatically as functions are called and return. You do not need to free stack
memory; it is reclaimed automatically.

::: {.tip}
**Trap:** Never return a pointer to a local variable. The memory is freed when the
function returns, and the pointer becomes a **dangling pointer** — it points to
memory that no longer belongs to you:

```c
int *bad(void) {
    int x = 42;
    return &x;   // BUG: x is destroyed when bad() returns
}
```
:::

\index{static}
## Static Local Variables

A **static local variable** has the scope of a local variable but the lifetime
of a global. It is declared inside a function with the `static` keyword, created
once when the program starts, and retains its value between calls:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void count_calls(void) {
    static int count = 0;   // initialized once, persists between calls
    count++;
    printf("Called %d time(s)\n", count);
}

int main(void) {
    count_calls();   // Called 1 time(s)
    count_calls();   // Called 2 time(s)
    count_calls();   // Called 3 time(s)
    return 0;
}
```

Without `static`, `count` would be reset to 0 on every call. With `static`, it
lives in the data segment (like a global) but is only accessible inside
`count_calls`.

\index{malloc}
\index{free}
## Dynamic Allocation: `malloc` and `free`

```c
void *malloc(size_t size);
void free(void *ptr);
```

Sometimes you need memory that outlives the function that created it, or memory
whose size you do not know at compile time. For this, C provides `malloc` and
`free` from `<stdlib.h>`.

\index{heap}
`malloc` allocates a block of memory on the **heap** and returns a pointer to it.
The heap is a region of memory that persists until you explicitly release it:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(void) {
    int *nums = malloc(5 * sizeof(int));
    if (nums == NULL) {
        printf("Allocation failed!\n");
        return 1;
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        nums[i] = (i + 1) * 10;
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        printf("nums[%d] = %d\n", i, nums[i]);
    }

    free(nums);   // release the memory back to the system
    return 0;
}
```

`malloc` returns a `void *` — a generic pointer that can be assigned to any
pointer type without a cast in C. It returns `NULL` if the allocation fails.
Always check for `NULL` after calling `malloc`.
Having said that, there is a school of thought held by some very good engineers that `NULL` checks just clutter the code.
To handle `NULL` gracefully, there will be a check and logic every place where it could be `NULL`, so you end up with checks and logic that are rarely used and almost never tested.
If you are out of memory, you'll probably need to shut down the program, so the reasoning goes that if you try to use a NULL pointer the CPU will do the check for you.
For safety-critical systems, the above argument does not hold, although those systems often forbid the use of dynamically allocated memory entirely.


::: {.tip}
\index{memory leak}
**Tip:** There are no smart pointers in C. There is no RAII. There is no garbage
collector. If you call `malloc`, you *must* call `free` when you are done. If
you forget, you leak memory. If you call `free` twice on the same pointer, you
get undefined behavior. If you use a pointer after freeing it, you get undefined
behavior. Memory management in C is entirely your responsibility.
:::

\index{calloc}
`calloc` is a variant that allocates memory and initializes it to zero:

```c
void *calloc(size_t count, size_t size);
```

```c
int *nums = calloc(5, sizeof(int));  // 5 ints, all initialized to 0
```

\index{realloc}
And `realloc` lets you resize a previously allocated block:

```c
void *realloc(void *ptr, size_t size);
```

```c
nums = realloc(nums, 10 * sizeof(int));  // grow to 10 ints
```

::: {.tip}
**Trap:** Never assign the result of `realloc` directly back to the same pointer.
If `realloc` fails, it returns `NULL` and the original memory is not freed — so
`nums = realloc(nums, ...)` loses your only pointer to the original block,
causing a memory leak. Use a temporary pointer instead:

```c
int *tmp = realloc(nums, 10 * sizeof(int));
if (tmp == NULL) {
    // handle error — nums is still valid
} else {
    nums = tmp;
}
```
:::

\index{memcpy}
\index{memset}
## Working with Raw Memory: `memcpy` and `memset`

Two functions from `<string.h>` operate on raw bytes rather than strings. You
will see them constantly in C code:

`memset` fills a block of memory with a byte value. It is commonly used to zero
out a buffer:

```c
void *memset(void *s, int c, size_t n);
```

```c
int nums[10];
memset(nums, 0, sizeof(nums));   // set all bytes to 0
```

`memcpy` copies a block of bytes from one location to another. Unlike `strcpy`,
it does not stop at a `'\0'` — you tell it exactly how many bytes to copy:

```c
void *memcpy(void *dest, const void *src, size_t n);
```

```c
int src[] = {10, 20, 30};
int dest[3];
memcpy(dest, src, sizeof(src));  // copy all 12 bytes (3 ints × 4 bytes)
```

::: {.tip}
\index{memmove}
**Trap:** `memcpy` requires that the source and destination do not overlap. If
they might overlap (e.g., shifting elements within the same array), use
`memmove` instead, which handles overlapping regions correctly.

```c
void *memmove(void *dest, const void *src, size_t n);
```
:::

## Where Variables Live: A Summary

| Kind | Where | Lifetime | Example |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Global | Data segment | Entire program | `int count = 0;` (outside functions) |
| Local | Stack | Until function returns | `int x = 5;` (inside a function) |
| Static local | Data segment | Entire program | `static int n = 0;` (inside a function) |
| Dynamic | Heap | Until you call `free` | `int *p = malloc(...)` |

## Try It: Memory Lifetimes

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int total = 0;   // global — lives for the whole program

void add_to_total(int n) {
    int local = n;       // local — gone when add_to_total returns
    total += local;
}

int main(void) {
    add_to_total(10);
    add_to_total(20);
    printf("Total: %d\n", total);    // 30

    // dynamic — lives until we free it
    int *data = malloc(3 * sizeof(int));
    if (data == NULL) return 1;

    data[0] = 1985;
    data[1] = 1986;
    data[2] = 1987;

    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        printf("data[%d] = %d\n", i, data[i]);
    }

    free(data);
    return 0;
}
```

## Key Points

- Global variables live for the entire program; local variables live only until
  the function returns.
- Static local variables have the scope of a local but the lifetime of a
  global.
- `malloc` allocates memory on the heap. You must call `free` when done.
- `calloc` allocates and zeroes memory. `realloc` resizes an allocation.
- `memcpy` copies bytes between non-overlapping regions. Use `memmove` for
  overlapping regions.
- `memset` fills a block of memory with a byte value.

## Exercises

1. **Think about it:** Why would you choose `calloc` over `malloc` followed by
   `memset` to zero?

2. **What does this print?**

    ```c
    #include <stdio.h>

    void counter(void) {
        static int n = 0;
        n++;
        printf("%d ", n);
    }

    int main(void) {
        counter(); counter(); counter();
        return 0;
    }
    ```

3. **Calculation:** On a system where `int` is 32 bits, how many bytes does
   `malloc(5 * sizeof(int))` allocate?

4. **Where is the bug?**

    ```c
    int *p = malloc(10 * sizeof(int));
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        p[i] = i;
    }
    free(p);
    printf("%d\n", p[0]);
    ```

5. **Where is the bug?**

    ```c
    int *a = malloc(5 * sizeof(int));
    int *b = a;
    free(a);
    free(b);
    ```

6. **Write a program** that uses `malloc` to allocate an array of `n` integers
   (where `n` is provided by the user via `scanf`), fills the array with
   squares (0, 1, 4, 9, ...), prints them, and frees the memory.

\newpage

\index{string}
# 4. Strings

In C++, you use `std::string` and barely think about what is happening under the
hood. In C, there is no string type at all. \index{null terminator}A "string" in C is just an array of
`char` that ends with a null character `'\0'`. Every string function in C depends
on finding that null terminator to know where the string ends.

## Declaring C Strings

There are several ways to create a string in C:

```c
char greeting[] = "Hola, mundo";        // compiler sizes it: 12 bytes (11 + '\0')
char band[20] = "Depeche Mode";         // 20-byte buffer, only 13 used
char empty[10] = "";                     // 10 bytes, first byte is '\0'
```

When you write `"Hola, mundo"`, the compiler automatically adds a `'\0'` at the
end. The array `greeting` is 12 bytes: 11 visible characters plus the null
terminator.

::: {.tip}
**Trap:** Always remember the null terminator when sizing your buffers. The
string `"hello"` needs 6 bytes, not 5. Off-by-one errors with null terminators
are one of the most common bugs in C.
:::

## String Functions

C provides a library of string manipulation functions in `<string.h>`. These are
the ones you will use most:

\index{strlen}
**`strlen` — Get the Length**

```c
size_t strlen(const char *s);
```

Returns the number of characters before the null terminator:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(void) {
    char song[] = "Take On Me";
    printf("'%s' has %zu characters\n", song, strlen(song));  // 10
    return 0;
}
```

Note that `strlen` does not count the `'\0'`. The array holding `"Take On Me"`
is 11 bytes, but `strlen` returns 10.

\index{strcpy}
\index{strncpy}
**`strcpy` / `strncpy` — Copy a String**

```c
char *strcpy(char *dest, const char *src);
char *strncpy(char *dest, const char *src, size_t n);
```

`strcpy` copies the source string (including the null terminator) into the
destination buffer. You must make sure the destination is large enough:

```c
char dest[20];
strcpy(dest, "Tainted Love");  // copies 13 bytes (12 chars + '\0')
```

`strncpy` is the safer variant — it copies at most `n` characters:

```c
char dest[10];
strncpy(dest, "Enjoy the Silence", 9);
dest[9] = '\0';  // strncpy does NOT guarantee null termination!
```

::: {.tip}
**Wut:** `strncpy` does not null-terminate the destination if the source is
longer than `n`. Always set the last byte yourself:
`dest[sizeof(dest) - 1] = '\0';`
:::

\index{strcmp}
**`strcmp` — Compare Strings**

```c
int strcmp(const char *s1, const char *s2);
```

In C++, you can compare strings with `==`. In C, you cannot — using `==` on
two `char` arrays compares the *addresses*, not the contents. Use `strcmp`
instead:

```c
char a[] = "Rush";
char b[] = "Rush";

if (a == b) {
    // This compares ADDRESSES, not content — almost always false
}

if (strcmp(a, b) == 0) {
    // This compares the actual characters — correct!
    printf("Same band!\n");
}
```

`strcmp` returns 0 if the strings are equal, a negative value if the first is
lexicographically less, and a positive value if it is greater.

::: {.tip}
**Trap:** Yes, `strcmp` returns 0 for equal strings. It is a common source of
confusion. Think of it as returning the "difference" between the strings — zero
means no difference.
:::

\index{strchr}
\index{strrchr}
**`strchr` / `strrchr` — Find a Character**

```c
char *strchr(const char *s, int c);
char *strrchr(const char *s, int c);
```

`strchr` finds the first occurrence of a character. `strrchr` finds the last:

```c
char lyric[] = "Don't You Forget About Me";
char *first_o = strchr(lyric, 'o');    // points to 'o' in "Don't"
char *last_o = strrchr(lyric, 'o');    // points to 'o' in "About"

if (first_o != NULL) {
    printf("First 'o' at position %td\n", first_o - lyric);
}
```

Both functions return a pointer to the found character, or `NULL` if the
character is not in the string.

\index{strstr}
**`strstr` — Find a Substring**

```c
char *strstr(const char *haystack, const char *needle);
```

Finds the first occurrence of a substring within a string:

```c
char title[] = "Blade Runner 1982";
char *found = strstr(title, "Runner");
if (found != NULL) {
    printf("Found: %s\n", found);  // "Runner 1982"
}
```

Like `strchr`, it returns a pointer to the start of the match, or `NULL` if not
found.

\index{strcat}
\index{strncat}
**`strcat` / `strncat` — Concatenate Strings**

```c
char *strcat(char *dest, const char *src);
char *strncat(char *dest, const char *src, size_t n);
```

`strcat` appends one string to the end of another:

```c
char message[50] = "I'll be ";
strcat(message, "back");
printf("%s\n", message);  // "I'll be back"
```

This works fine as long as the destination buffer is large enough. But `strcat`
does not check bounds — if you run out of space, it writes past the end of the
array.

::: {.tip}
\index{buffer overflow}
**Trap:** `strcat` is one of the most dangerous functions in C. It has no way to
know how large the destination buffer is, so it blindly appends bytes. If the
combined strings exceed the buffer size, you get a **buffer overflow** — one of
the most common security vulnerabilities in the history of software. Use
`strncat` instead.
:::

`strncat` takes a maximum number of characters to append as the last argument.
Make sure to leave space for the null terminator, so if there are three bytes left in a buffer, the maximum number of characters to append would be 2.

```c
char buf[20] = "Hello";
strncat(buf, ", World!", sizeof(buf) - strlen(buf) - 1);
```

\index{strdup}
**`strdup` — Duplicate a String**

```c
char *strdup(const char *s);
```

`strdup` allocates new memory on the heap, copies the string into it, and
returns a pointer to the copy. You are responsible for freeing the memory when
you are done:

```c
char *copy = strdup("Video Killed the Radio Star");
printf("%s\n", copy);
free(copy);  // you must free memory allocated by strdup
```

::: {.tip}
**Tip:** `strdup` calls `malloc` internally. Every call to `strdup` must
eventually be paired with a call to `free`. If you forget, you have a memory
leak. Note that `strdup` is a POSIX function, not part of the C standard until
C23. It is available on virtually every system you will use, but compiling with
`-std=c99 -pedantic` or `-std=c11 -pedantic` will produce a warning.
:::

\index{strtok}
**`strtok` — Tokenize a String**

```c
char *strtok(char *str, const char *delim);
```

`strtok` splits a string into tokens separated by any character in a delimiter
set. In C++, you might use `std::istringstream` with `>>` or
`std::string::find` — in C, `strtok` is the standard approach:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(void) {
    char line[] = "Girls Just Want to Have Fun";

    char *tok = strtok(line, " ");
    while (tok != NULL) {
        printf("'%s'\n", tok);
        tok = strtok(NULL, " ");
    }
    return 0;
}
// Output:
// 'Girls'
// 'Just'
// 'Want'
// 'to'
// 'Have'
// 'Fun'
```

The first call passes the string to tokenize. Each subsequent call passes
`NULL` to continue tokenizing the same string. `strtok` returns `NULL` when
there are no more tokens.

There are two important gotchas. First, `strtok` **modifies the original
string** by replacing delimiter characters with `'\0'`. If you need the
original string preserved, make a copy with `strdup` before tokenizing.
Second, `strtok` stores its state in a hidden static variable, which means it
is **not thread-safe** and you cannot tokenize two strings at the same time.

::: {.tip}
\index{strtok\_r}
**Tip:** Use `strtok_r` (POSIX) or `strtok_s` (C11 Annex K / Windows) instead
of `strtok`. These reentrant versions take an extra `char **saveptr` parameter
to store the tokenizer state, making them safe to use in multi-threaded
programs and allowing nested tokenization:

```c
char *strtok_r(char *str, const char *delim, char **saveptr);
```

```c
char *saveptr;
char *tok = strtok_r(line, " ", &saveptr);
while (tok != NULL) {
    printf("'%s'\n", tok);
    tok = strtok_r(NULL, " ", &saveptr);
}
```
:::

## The Dangers of `strcat`

Let's look at a concrete example of why `strcat` is dangerous:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(void) {
    char buf[12] = "Buenas ";    // 7 chars + '\0', 4 bytes remaining

    // "noches" is 6 chars — doesn't fit in 4 remaining bytes!
    strcat(buf, "noches");       // BUFFER OVERFLOW — undefined behavior

    printf("%s\n", buf);         // might print garbage, might crash
    return 0;
}
```

The buffer is 12 bytes, `"Buenas "` uses 8 (including the `'\0'`), and
`"noches"` needs 7 more bytes (including its `'\0'`). That is 14 bytes total in
a 12-byte buffer. The extra bytes overwrite whatever happens to be next to the
buffer in memory, which can corrupt other variables, crash the program, or —
worst of all — create a security exploit.

\index{sprintf}
\index{sscanf}
## A Preview: `sprintf` and `sscanf`

```c
int sprintf(char *str, const char *format, ...);
int sscanf(const char *str, const char *format, ...);
```

C has two powerful functions for building and parsing strings that we will cover
in detail in the Standard I/O chapter: `sprintf` writes formatted output into a string
buffer (like `printf` but to a string), and `sscanf` reads formatted input from
a string (like `scanf` but from a string). They are the C programmer's Swiss
Army knife for string manipulation:

```c
char result[50];
int year = 1985;
sprintf(result, "The year is %d. Que bueno!", year);
// result is now "The year is 1985. Que bueno!"
```

## Try It: String Starter

This program exercises several string functions so you can see them in action:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(void) {
    // strlen
    char song[] = "Sweet Dreams";
    printf("Song: '%s' (%zu chars)\n", song, strlen(song));

    // strcpy
    char copy[20];
    strcpy(copy, song);
    printf("Copy: '%s'\n", copy);

    // strcmp
    printf("Compare '%s' to '%s': %d\n", song, copy, strcmp(song, copy));
    printf("Compare 'A' to 'B': %d\n", strcmp("A", "B"));

    // strcat
    char greeting[30] = "Buenos ";
    strcat(greeting, "dias");
    printf("Greeting: '%s'\n", greeting);

    // strchr and strstr
    char *ch = strchr(song, 'D');
    if (ch) printf("Found 'D' at position %td\n", ch - song);

    char *sub = strstr(song, "Dreams");
    if (sub) printf("Found substring: '%s'\n", sub);

    // strdup
    char *dup = strdup("Never Gonna Give You Up");
    printf("Duplicate: '%s'\n", dup);
    free(dup);

    return 0;
}
```

## Key Points

- C strings are `char` arrays terminated by `'\0'`. There is no `std::string`.
- Always account for the null terminator when sizing buffers.
- Use `strcmp` to compare strings — the `==` operator compares addresses, not
  content.
- `strcpy` and `strcat` do not check buffer bounds. Prefer `strncpy` and
  `strncat`.
- `strdup` allocates memory with `malloc` — you must `free` the result.
- `strtok` splits strings into tokens but modifies the original string and is
  not thread-safe. Use `strtok_r` or `strtok_s` instead.
- `strlen` returns the number of characters *before* the `'\0'`, not the buffer
  size.

## Exercises

1. **Think about it:** Why does `strcmp` return 0 for equal strings rather than
   1? How does this relate to the function's actual purpose?

2. **What does this print?**

    ```c
    char s[] = "Ghostbusters";
    printf("%zu %zu\n", strlen(s), sizeof(s));
    ```

3. **Calculation:** What is `sizeof(buf)` for `char buf[20] = "Hola";`?

4. **Where is the bug?**

    ```c
    char buf[10] = "Livin'";
    strcat(buf, " on a Prayer");
    printf("%s\n", buf);
    ```

5. **Where is the bug?**

    ```c
    char *a = "Hello";
    char *b = "Hello";
    if (a == b) {
        printf("Equal\n");
    } else {
        printf("Not equal\n");
    }
    ```

    (Hint: what does `==` actually compare here? Is the output guaranteed?)

6. **Write a program** that reads a string from the user, reverses it in place
   using pointer arithmetic, and prints the result.

\newpage

# 5. Numbers and Casting

To the CPU, everything is just a number.
It has no concept of characters, strings, pointers, or objects.
The CPU only knows about the numeric values in registers and memory addresses.

The types we assign to variables in C do not change the underlying bits; they simply tell the *compiler* how we want to interpret and use those numbers.
Different numeric types provide different sizes (which determines the range of values they can hold) and different semantics (like whether they are signed or unsigned, integer or floating-point).

## Everything is a Number

\index{char}
A `char` is just a small integer (usually 8 bits). Assigning `'A'` is exactly the same as assigning the number `65` (in ASCII). You can perform math on characters just as you would on any integer:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    char grade = 'A';
    int score = 65;
    
    // Both variables hold the exact same numeric value
    printf("grade as char: %c, as int: %d\n", grade, grade);
    printf("score as char: %c, as int: %d\n", score, score);
    
    char next_grade = grade + 1; // 65 + 1 = 66
    printf("Next grade: %c\n", next_grade); // 'B'
    
    return 0;
}
```

A pointer is also just a number. Specifically, it is an integer that represents a memory address. When you provide a pointer type like `int *`, you are telling the compiler: "Treat this address number as the location of an `int`." C allows you to print the address just like a number, usually formatted as hexadecimal using the `%p` specifier for pointers:

```c
int val = 1986; // Year "Danger Zone" charted
int *p = &val;

printf("Address: %p\n", (void *)p); // e.g., 0x7ffd9b8
```

## Strings are Not Special

Because everything is just a number, C has no native understanding of "strings." A string in C is merely an array of characters (small integers) that ends with a special `0` byte (the null terminator, `'\0'`). 

When you write a string literal like `"Africa"`, the compiler simply lays out an array of numbers (`65, 102, 114, 105, 99, 97, 0`) in read-only memory and gives you a `char *` pointer to the first number (`65`). The standard libraries (`<string.h>`) are what give us the illusion of strings, by processing these arrays of numbers until they hit that `0` byte.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    char word[] = "Hola";

    printf("String: %s\n", word);
    printf("Bytes: ");
    for (int i = 0; i < (int)sizeof(word); i++)
        printf("%d ", word[i]);
    printf("\n");

    return 0;
}
// Output:
// String: Hola
// Bytes: 72 111 108 97 0
```

The five bytes are the ASCII values for `H`, `o`, `l`, `a`, and the null terminator.

## Converting Strings to Numbers

Because strings are really arrays of characters, the text `"1986"` is entirely different from the integer `1986`. Unsurprisingly, converting between the text representation of a number and its purely numeric form is a very common task.

\index{strtol}
To translate a string representation into an actual integer, use `strtol` (string to long) from `<stdlib.h>`:

```c
long strtol(const char *str, char **endptr, int base);
```

The first argument is the string to parse. The second argument, `endptr`, is an optional pointer that `strtol` sets to point to the first character after the parsed number (pass `NULL` if you don't need it). The third argument is the numeric base (10 for decimal, 16 for hex, 0 to auto-detect from the prefix).

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(void) {
    char *year_str = "1986";
    
    // 10 is the base (base-10 decimal)
    long year = strtol(year_str, NULL, 10);
    
    printf("Year: %ld\n", year);
    return 0;
}
```

\index{strtod}
For floating-point conversions, use `strtod` (string to double) in the same way — it takes a string, an optional `endptr`, but no base argument since floating-point literals are always decimal.

Later on when we discuss Standard I/O, we will cover `sprintf` and `sscanf`, which provide convenient formatting routines to convert back and forth between strings and numbers.

\index{integer types}
## Integer Types

Integers are the most common type of number you will use in C.
The CPU can do arithmetic on integers very quickly, and they are essential for pointer arithmetic and array indexing.
Integers can be signed or unsigned and can be of different sizes.
Here is a table of the common sizes, ranges, and literal suffixes of integers on most 64-bit systems:

| Type | Bytes | Range | Suffix |
|------|:-----:|-------|:------:|
| `signed char` | 1 | $-128$ to $127$ | |
| `unsigned char` | 1 | $0$ to $255$ | |
| `short` | 2 | $-32{,}768$ to $32{,}767$ | |
| `unsigned short` | 2 | $0$ to $65{,}535$ | |
| `int` | 4 | $-2^{31}$ to $2^{31}-1$ | |
| `unsigned int` | 4 | $0$ to $2^{32}-1$ | `U` |
| `long` | 8 | $-2^{63}$ to $2^{63}-1$ | `L` |
| `unsigned long` | 8 | $0$ to $2^{64}-1$ | `UL` |
| `long long` | 8 | $-2^{63}$ to $2^{63}-1$ | `LL` |
| `unsigned long long` | 8 | $0$ to $2^{64}-1$ | `ULL` |

Note that the sizes and ranges specified here can vary.
The C standard's rules about sizes are so vague they aren't worth quoting here :'(.
Notice that the range is 1 number larger for negative numbers than for positive numbers.
This is because most systems use **two's complement** representation for signed integers.
The top bit indicates the sign: if it is set, the number is negative.
But the remaining bits are not a simple magnitude — two's complement encodes negative values so that addition and subtraction work the same way for signed and unsigned numbers.
A consequence of this encoding is that there is one more negative value than positive values, and zero is represented only one way (with the sign bit clear).
While this may not make your math teacher happy, it gets worse when we talk about floating point numbers!

\index{sizeof}
\index{limits.h}
You can explore the actual sizes and ranges on your machine using `<limits.h>`:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <limits.h>

int main(void) {
    printf("char:      %zu byte,  range %d to %d\n",
           sizeof(char), CHAR_MIN, CHAR_MAX);
    printf("short:     %zu bytes, range %d to %d\n",
           sizeof(short), SHRT_MIN, SHRT_MAX);
    printf("int:       %zu bytes, range %d to %d\n",
           sizeof(int), INT_MIN, INT_MAX);
    printf("long:      %zu bytes, range %ld to %ld\n",
           sizeof(long), LONG_MIN, LONG_MAX);
    printf("long long: %zu bytes, range %lld to %lld\n",
           sizeof(long long), LLONG_MIN, LLONG_MAX);

    return 0;
}
```

::: {.tip}
**Trap:** You will notice that most types are signed by default except for `char`.
Sadly, on different architectures `char` can be either signed or unsigned, and even more sadly, on x86_64 CPUs, `char` is signed by default, and on ARM CPUs, `char` is unsigned by default! Watch out!
:::

\index{integer promotion}
### Integer Promotion

When you use an integer type in an expression that is equal to or less than the size of `int`, it is automatically promoted to `int` if `int` is large enough to hold all the values of the type. Otherwise, it is promoted to `unsigned int`. This is called integer promotion.

For expressions that involve larger integer types, the rules generally promote to the signedness and the size of the larger type.

::: {.tip}
\index{size\_t}
**Trap:** One place where this can cause problems is when using `strlen`. `strlen` returns a `size_t` which is an unsigned integer type. If you subtract two `size_t` values, the result will be a `size_t`. If the first value is smaller than the second value, the result will be a large positive number. This can cause problems when using the result in other expressions.
:::

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(void) {
    char *a = "Jump";       // strlen = 4
    char *b = "Jump!!!!";   // strlen = 8

    // size_t is unsigned, so 4 - 8 wraps around!
    size_t diff = strlen(a) - strlen(b);
    printf("strlen(a) - strlen(b) = %zu\n", diff);

    // cast to a signed type to get the correct result
    long sdiff = (long)strlen(a) - (long)strlen(b);
    printf("Signed difference:      %ld\n", sdiff);

    return 0;
}
// Output:
// strlen(a) - strlen(b) = 18446744073709551612
// Signed difference:      -4
```

\index{float}
\index{double}
## Floating Point Types

Floating point numbers are used for decimal numbers that may have fractional components.
They also vary in size and precision, but they are always signed.
Here is a table of the common sizes, ranges, and literal suffixes of floating point numbers on most 64-bit systems:

| Type | Size | Range | Literal Suffix |
|------|------|-------|----------------|
| `float` | 4 bytes | -3.4e+38 to 3.4e+38 | `F` |
| `double` | 8 bytes | -1.7e+308 to 1.7e+308 | *(none, default)* |
| `long double` | 16 bytes | -1.2e+4932 to 1.2e+4932 | `L` |

Floating point numbers also have a sign bit, but unlike integers, the sign bit can be set on zero.
This means floating point numbers have two zeros: positive zero and negative zero.
(They compare as equal to each other though.)
Floating point numbers can also be used to represent infinity and NaN (Not a Number).

Floating point numbers cannot always exactly represent a value.
The fractional part of a number is stored as a sum of negative powers of 2 (1/2, 1/4, 1/8, ...).
Values like `0.5` (which is 1/2) and `0.25` (which is 1/4) can be represented exactly, but values like `0.1` and `0.2` cannot.
Rounding is used to get as close as possible to the value you want.
This can cause surprising results: for example, `0.1 + 0.2` is not exactly equal to `0.3`.

Observe the following code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void) {
    float f = 1.2;
    if (f != 1.2) printf("what?!?\n");
    if (f == 1.2f) printf("ok\n");
}
```

You would expect only the `ok` message to print, but the `what` message prints too!
Why?
The literal `1.2` is a `double`. When it is assigned to `f`, the value is rounded to fit in a `float`, losing some precision.
In the first `if`, `f` is promoted back to `double` for the comparison, but the precision lost during the assignment is not recovered, so `f` and `1.2` are not equal.
In the second `if`, `1.2f` is a `float` literal, which was rounded the same way, so the comparison succeeds.

\index{cast}
## Casting

A **cast** is a way of forcing the compiler to treat a value of one type as another type. The syntax is `(type) value`. 

Casts in C are much simpler than in C++.
They are also much less magical!
C has a single unified cast syntax `(type)value`.
You can only cast between numeric types (`scalar` type is the term usually used), including pointers.
The following table summarizes the allowed casts:

| From / To | Integer | Floating-Point | Pointer |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Integer** | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Floating-Point** | Yes | Yes | No |
| **Pointer** | Yes | No | Yes |

Casting from floating point to integer drops the decimal part (it does not round).
As long as the numbers fit into the target type, the conversion works well.
But if the number is too large, you get the dreaded \index{undefined behavior}"undefined behavior" — anything can happen.

Casting from a floating point to a pointer doesn't make sense, but you can do it if you cast to an integer type first.
Why would you ever want to do that though?
Keep your coworkers happy and don't do it.

By using a cast, you are essentially telling the compiler: "I know what I am doing, suppress any warnings, and just treat this as the type I specified."

```c
double pi = 3.14159;
int roughly_pi = (int)pi; // truncates to 3
```

Because C trusts you implicitly, casting can be dangerous. Magic *does not* happen when you cast.

::: {.tip}
**Trap:** A classic beginner mistake is trying to convert a string to an integer by casting the pointer.

```c
char *movie_year = "1985";  // The Goonies
int bad_year = (int)movie_year; // THIS IS A BUG! not 1985!!
```

Casting a `char *` string to an `int` does not convert the text `"1985"` into the number `1985`. It tells the compiler to take the *memory address* where the string is stored and chop or pad it to fit inside an `int`. On a 64-bit system, the pointer is 8 bytes and the `int` is 4 bytes, so compiling this code will actually result in a warning that you are casting a pointer to an integer of different size! Always use functions like `strtol` to parse strings into numbers.
:::

\index{void pointer}
### Casting pointers to other pointers

`void *` is a pointer that can point to anything. It is a pointer to a generic memory location.
This is why you don't have to cast pointers returned by `malloc` to a specific pointer type.

Take care when casting pointers to other pointer types.
You must understand the memory layout of the structures you are working with.
One common pattern is using a `char *` for byte-level arithmetic on a base address plus an offset, and then casting the result to the desired structure pointer type.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    int nums[] = {1984, 1985, 1986, 1987};

    void *vp = nums;            // any pointer converts to void *
    int *ip = (int *)vp;        // cast back to use it
    printf("First: %d\n", ip[0]);

    // byte-level access with char *
    char *bp = (char *)nums;
    printf("First byte of nums[0]: 0x%02x\n", (unsigned char)bp[0]);

    return 0;
}
// Output:
// First: 1984
// First byte of nums[0]: 0xc0
```

## Try It: Numbers Starter

This program exercises the key concepts from this chapter: characters as numbers, string-to-number conversion, integer sizes, and casting.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <limits.h>

int main(void) {
    // Characters are just numbers
    char ch = 'A';
    printf("'%c' is %d\n", ch, ch);
    printf("'%c' + 3 = '%c' (%d)\n", ch, ch + 3, ch + 3);

    // Strings are arrays of numbers
    char title[] = "Rio";
    printf("\"%s\" bytes: ", title);
    for (int i = 0; i < (int)sizeof(title); i++)
        printf("%d ", title[i]);
    printf("\n");

    // String to number conversion
    char *bpm_str = "120";
    long bpm = strtol(bpm_str, NULL, 10);
    printf("\"%s\" as a number: %ld\n", bpm_str, bpm);

    // Hex string to number
    long color = strtol("FF8000", NULL, 16);
    printf("0x%lX = %ld\n", color, color);

    // Integer sizes on this machine
    printf("\nsizeof(char)  = %zu\n", sizeof(char));
    printf("sizeof(short) = %zu\n", sizeof(short));
    printf("sizeof(int)   = %zu\n", sizeof(int));
    printf("sizeof(long)  = %zu\n", sizeof(long));
    printf("UINT_MAX      = %u\n", UINT_MAX);

    // Casting: float to int truncates
    double tempo = 120.7;
    int whole = (int)tempo;
    printf("\n(int)%.1f = %d\n", tempo, whole);

    // The classic trap: casting a pointer
    char *year_str = "1982";
    long bad  = (long)year_str;          // address, not 1982!
    long good = strtol(year_str, NULL, 10);
    printf("(long)\"1982\"        = %ld (an address!)\n", bad);
    printf("strtol(\"1982\", ...) = %ld\n", good);

    // void * round-trip
    int val = 42;
    void *vp = &val;
    int *ip = (int *)vp;
    printf("\nvoid * round-trip: %d\n", *ip);

    int hex_val = 0xbadd00d;
    printf("%d %x\n", hex_val, hex_val);
    // let's look at the bytes of hex_val (int has 4 bytes)
    unsigned char *raw = (unsigned char *)&hex_val;
    printf("little-endian: %02x %02x %02x %02x\n",
           raw[0], raw[1], raw[2], raw[3]);

    return 0;
}
```

## Key Points

- Under the hood, everything (characters, pointers) is just a number.
- C does not have native "strings," only arrays of numbers ended with a `0`.
- The type of a variable tells the compiler how you intend to interpret its numeric bits.
- C casts `(type) value` assert your intent to the compiler. It assumes you know what you are doing.
- Casting a pointer to an integer simply gives you the raw numeric memory address, not the parsed contents of a string. Use `strtol` to parse strings.

## Exercises

1. **Think about it:** C++ provides several different cast operators (`static_cast`, `reinterpret_cast`, etc.) whereas C provides only one. What are the advantages of C++'s approach over C's single cast syntax?
2. **What does this print?**

    ```c
    char letter = 'C';
    printf("%c %d\n", letter + 2, letter + 2);
    ```

3. **Calculation:** Assuming a 64-bit system where pointers are 8 bytes and `int` is 4 bytes, what is the output of `sizeof("Danger")` and what is the output of `sizeof((int)0)`?
4. **Where is the bug?**

    ```c
    #include <stdio.h>

    int main(void) {
        char *score_str = "100";
        int score = (int)score_str;
        printf("You got a %d percent!\n", score);
        return 0;
    }
    ```

5. **Write a program** that declares a `double` variable with a fractional component and uses casting to separate the integer part from the fractional part. Print both pieces.

\newpage

# 6. Standard I/O

C's `<stdio.h>` library is your replacement for C++ `iostream`. It provides
`printf` and `scanf` for formatted output and input, file operations with
`fopen` and `fclose`, and binary I/O with `fread` and `fwrite`. Everything
\index{FILE}
flows through the `FILE *` type — an opaque pointer to a structure that tracks
the state of an I/O stream.

\index{scanf}
## `scanf` for Input

```c
int scanf(const char *format, ...);
```

You have already seen `printf` for output. For input, C uses `scanf`, which
reads formatted data from standard input:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    int year;
    printf("Enter a year: ");
    scanf("%d", &year);
    printf("You entered: %d\n", year);
    return 0;
}
```

Notice the `&` before `year`. Since C is pass by value, `scanf` needs the
*address* of the variable so it can store the result there. Forgetting the `&`
is a classic bug — the program compiles but crashes or produces garbage at
runtime.

`scanf` uses similar format specifiers to `printf`, but not identical ones.
Notably, `scanf` uses `%lf` for `double` while `printf` uses `%f`:


```c
char name[50];
double gpa;
scanf("%s %lf", name, &gpa);
```

Note that `name` does not need `&` because an array name already points to the bytes we want to read into.
But `gpa` does need a `&`, because `scanf` needs to know where `gpa` is stored to fill it in.

::: {.tip}
**Trap:** `scanf("%s", ...)` reads a single word (stopping at whitespace). It
also has no bounds checking — it will happily overflow your buffer. Use a
width specifier like `%49s` to limit input to 49 characters (plus `'\0'`).
:::

\index{scan set}
## Scan Sets

`scanf` supports **scan set specifiers** with `%[...]`, which let you define
exactly which characters to accept. The scan set reads characters as long as
they are in the set, and stops at the first character that is not:

```c
char vowels[20];
scanf("%19[aeiouAEIOU]", vowels);  // reads only vowels, stops at first non-vowel
```

A caret `^` at the start of the set **negates** it — read everything *except*
the listed characters. This gives you a way to read an entire line with `scanf`,
since `%[^\n]` reads everything up to (but not including) the newline:

```c
char line[80];
scanf("%79[^\n]", line);   // reads a full line (up to 79 chars)
printf("You said: %s\n", line);
```

Always include a width limit to prevent buffer overflow, just like with `%s`.

Scan sets work with `sscanf` too. Here is an example that parses a structured
string:

```c
char buf[] = "Track 03: 99 Luftballons";
int track;
char title[50];
sscanf(buf, "Track %d: %49[^\n]", &track, title);
// track is 3, title is "99 Luftballons"
```

::: {.tip}
**Tip:** `%[^\n]` is the `scanf` way to read a line, but `fgets` is generally
safer and simpler for line-oriented input. Use scan sets when you need to parse
structured input where only certain characters are valid.
:::

## The `%m` Modifier (POSIX)

With `%s` and `%[...]`, you must always provide a buffer that is large enough.
The POSIX `%m` modifier (called the **assignment-allocation** modifier) tells
`scanf` to `malloc` the buffer for you. Instead of passing a `char[]`, you pass
a `char **` and `scanf` allocates exactly enough memory:

```c
char *line = NULL;
scanf("%m[^\n]", &line);       // scanf mallocs the buffer
printf("You said: %s\n", line);
free(line);                     // you must free it
```

Notice `&line` — `scanf` needs a pointer to your `char *` so it can fill it in
with the address of the newly allocated buffer. This eliminates buffer overflow
risk entirely, since the buffer is always the right size.

`%ms` works the same way for single words:

```c
char *word = NULL;
scanf("%ms", &word);   // reads one word, malloc'd to fit
free(word);
```

::: {.tip}
**Tip:** `%m` is a POSIX extension (available on Linux, macOS, and most Unix
systems) and is not part of the C standard. It will not work with MSVC on
Windows. When portability is not a concern, `%m` is an excellent way to avoid
buffer sizing headaches.
:::

\index{stdin}
\index{stdout}
\index{stderr}
## `stdin`, `stdout`, and `stderr`

When your C program starts, three streams (of type `FILE *`) are already open:

| Stream | Purpose | C++ equivalent |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `stdin` | Standard input (keyboard) | `std::cin` |
| `stdout` | Standard output (screen) | `std::cout` |
| `stderr` | Standard error (screen) | `std::cerr` |

`printf(...)` is actually shorthand for `fprintf(stdout, ...)`. You can write
to `stderr` for error messages:

```c
fprintf(stderr, "Error: file not found\n");
```

Error messages sent to `stderr` are not affected by output redirection
(`./program > output.txt` only redirects `stdout`), so error messages still
appear on the screen.
`./program 2> err.txt` will redirect errors to `err.txt` and `stdout` will appear on the screen.

\index{fprintf}
\index{fscanf}
## `fprintf` and `fscanf`

```c
int fprintf(FILE *stream, const char *format, ...);
int fscanf(FILE *stream, const char *format, ...);
```

`fprintf` and `fscanf` are the file versions of `printf` and `scanf`. They take
a `FILE *` as the first argument:

```c
fprintf(stdout, "Hello\n");           // same as printf("Hello\n")
fprintf(stderr, "Something broke\n"); // write to stderr
```

More usefully, you can use them with files you have opened yourself. Here is
`fscanf` reading from a file:

```c
FILE *f = fopen("scores.txt", "r");
if (f != NULL) {
    char name[50];
    int score;
    while (fscanf(f, "%49s %d", name, &score) == 2) {
        printf("%s scored %d\n", name, score);
    }
    fclose(f);
}
```

`fscanf` returns the number of items successfully read, so checking the return
value tells you whether the read succeeded.

\index{fopen}
\index{fclose}
## Opening and Closing Files

```c
FILE *fopen(const char *path, const char *mode);
int fclose(FILE *stream);
```

To read or write a file, you open it with `fopen` and close it with `fclose`:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    FILE *f = fopen("log.txt", "w");
    if (f == NULL) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Cannot open file\n");
        return 1;
    }

    fprintf(f, "Under Pressure\n");
    fprintf(f, "Year: %d\n", 1981);

    fclose(f);
    return 0;
}
```

The second argument to `fopen` is the **mode string**:

| Mode | Meaning |
|:---|:---|
| `"r"` | Read (file must exist) |
| `"w"` | Write (creates or truncates) |
| `"a"` | Append (creates or appends) |
| `"r+"` | Read and write (file must exist) |
| `"w+"` | Read and write (creates or truncates) |
| `"a+"` | Read and append |

To open a file in **binary mode**, add `b` to the mode string: `"rb"`, `"wb"`,
`"ab"`, etc. On Unix systems, binary and text modes behave identically. On
Windows, text mode translates `\r\n` to `\n` on input and vice versa on
output — binary mode does not.

## `sprintf` and `sscanf`

`sprintf` writes formatted output into a string buffer instead of a stream.
`sscanf` reads formatted input from a string:

```c
char buf[100];
sprintf(buf, "Track %02d: %s", 3, "99 Luftballons");
// buf is now "Track 03: 99 Luftballons"

int track;
char title[50];
sscanf(buf, "Track %d: %49[^\n]", &track, title);
// track is 3, title is "99 Luftballons"
```

::: {.tip}
\index{snprintf}
**Trap:** `sprintf` has the same buffer overflow risk as `strcpy` — it does not
check the size of the destination buffer. Use `snprintf` for safety:

```c
int snprintf(char *str, size_t size, const char *format, ...);
```

```c
snprintf(buf, sizeof(buf), "Track %02d: %s", 3, "99 Luftballons");
```

`snprintf` guarantees it will not write more than `sizeof(buf)` bytes,
including the null terminator.
:::

`asprintf` (POSIX) goes one step further — it `malloc`s a buffer that is
exactly the right size, so you never have to guess:

```c
int asprintf(char **strp, const char *format, ...);
```

```c
char *msg;
asprintf(&msg, "Track %02d: %s", 3, "Mis Ojos Lloran Por Ti");
printf("%s\n", msg);   // "Track 03: Mis Ojos Lloran Por Ti"
free(msg);              // you must free it
```

Like `%m` in `scanf`, you pass a pointer to a `char *` and `asprintf` fills it
in with the address of the newly allocated string. It returns the number of
characters written, or -1 on failure.

::: {.tip}
**Tip:** `asprintf` is a POSIX/GNU extension, not part of the C standard. It is
available on Linux, macOS, and most Unix systems but not MSVC. When it is
available, it is the safest and most convenient way to build formatted strings —
no buffer sizing, no truncation, no overflow.
:::

\index{fread}
\index{fwrite}
## Binary I/O: `fread` and `fwrite`

```c
size_t fread(void *ptr, size_t size, size_t count, FILE *stream);
size_t fwrite(const void *ptr, size_t size, size_t count, FILE *stream);
```

For reading and writing raw binary data (not text), use `fread` and `fwrite`:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    int nums[] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};

    // Write binary data
    FILE *f = fopen("data.bin", "wb");
    fwrite(nums, sizeof(int), 5, f);
    fclose(f);

    // Read it back
    int result[5];
    f = fopen("data.bin", "rb");
    fread(result, sizeof(int), 5, f);
    fclose(f);

    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        printf("%d ", result[i]);   // 10 20 30 40 50
    }
    printf("\n");
    return 0;
}
```

Both functions take four arguments: a pointer to the data, the size of each
element, the number of elements, and the file stream. `fwrite` returns the
number of elements successfully written; `fread` returns the number of elements
successfully read.

\index{fgets}
## Reading Lines: `fgets`

```c
char *fgets(char *s, int size, FILE *stream);
```

`fgets` reads a line from a stream into a buffer. It stops when it has read
`size - 1` characters, encounters a newline (which it includes in the buffer),
or reaches end of file. It always null-terminates the result:

```c
char line[80];
while (fgets(line, sizeof(line), f) != NULL) {
    printf("%s", line);   // line already includes '\n'
}
```

`fgets` returns `NULL` at end of file or on error, making it easy to use in a
loop. It is generally safer than `scanf` for reading lines because it always
respects the buffer size.

\index{buffering}
\index{fflush}
## Buffering and `fflush`

`stdio` does not write directly to the output device on every call. Instead, it
accumulates data in an internal buffer and writes it in larger chunks for
efficiency. There are three buffering modes:

- **Full buffering:** Output is written when the buffer is full (default for
  files).
- **Line buffering:** Output is written when a `\n` is encountered (default for
  `stdout` when connected to a terminal).
- **Unbuffered:** Output is written immediately (default for `stderr`).

This means that `printf("Working...")` (no newline) will not appear on screen
immediately when `stdout` goes to a terminal, and will not
appear when redirected to a file until the buffer fills or the program exits. Use `fflush` to force the buffer
to be written:

```c
int fflush(FILE *stream);
```

```c
printf("Working...");
fflush(stdout);   // force output to appear now
// ... long computation ...
printf(" done!\n");
```

::: {.tip}
**Trap:** When `stdout` is connected to a terminal, output is **line
buffered** — a `\n` triggers a flush. When `stdout` is redirected to a file or
pipe, it is **fully buffered** — output may not appear until the buffer fills
up or the program exits. If you need output to appear immediately (e.g.,
progress indicators), call `fflush(stdout)` after printing. `stderr` is always
unbuffered, which is why error messages appear immediately.

## Try It: Standard I/O Starter

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(void) {
    // sprintf: format into a string
    char buf[100];
    sprintf(buf, "Track %02d: %s", 7, "Hungry Like the Wolf");
    printf("sprintf: %s\n", buf);

    // snprintf: safe version with size limit
    char small[15];
    snprintf(small, sizeof(small), "Year: %d", 1984);
    printf("snprintf: %s\n", small);

    // sscanf: parse from a string
    int track;
    char title[50];
    sscanf(buf, "Track %d: %49[^\n]", &track, title);
    printf("sscanf: track=%d title='%s'\n", track, title);

    // fprintf to stderr
    fprintf(stderr, "This goes to stderr\n");

    // fwrite/fread round-trip
    int nums[] = {10, 20, 30};
    FILE *f = fopen("/tmp/tryit_data.bin", "wb");
    fwrite(nums, sizeof(int), 3, f);
    fclose(f);

    int result[3];
    f = fopen("/tmp/tryit_data.bin", "rb");
    fread(result, sizeof(int), 3, f);
    fclose(f);

    printf("fread: %d %d %d\n", result[0], result[1], result[2]);

    return 0;
}
```

## Key Points

- `printf` writes to `stdout`; `fprintf` writes to any `FILE *`.
- `scanf` needs the address (`&`) of each variable — arrays are the exception
  since they decay to pointers.
- `fopen` returns `NULL` on failure — always check before using the file
  pointer.
- Add `"b"` to the mode string for binary files. This matters on Windows.
- `fread` and `fwrite` transfer raw bytes — no format conversion.
- `stdout` is line buffered at a terminal and fully buffered when redirected.
  Use `fflush` when you need output immediately.

## Exercises

1. **Think about it:** Why does `scanf` need the `&` operator for scalar
   variables but not for arrays?

2. **What does this print?**

    ```c
    char buf[50];
    sprintf(buf, "%s: %d", "Score", 100);
    printf("%zu\n", strlen(buf));
    ```

3. **Calculation:** If `buf` is declared as `char buf[20]` and you call
   `snprintf(buf, sizeof(buf), "Year: %d", 1984)`, how many characters
   (excluding the null terminator) are written to `buf`?

4. **Where is the bug?**

    ```c
    int x;
    scanf("%d", x);
    ```

5. **Where is the bug?**

    ```c
    FILE *f = fopen("noexist.txt", "r");
    fprintf(f, "Hello\n");
    fclose(f);
    ```

6. **Think about it:** You run `./program > output.txt` and your program
   contains both `printf` and `fprintf(stderr, ...)` calls. Which messages
   appear in `output.txt` and which appear on the screen? Why?

7. **Write a program** that opens a text file, writes five lines to it (your
   choice of content), closes it, reopens it for reading, reads and prints each
   line using `fgets`, then closes it again.

# 7. Low-Level I/O

The `<stdio.h>` functions you learned in the previous chapter are built on top
of a lower-level I/O interface provided by the operating system. These system
calls — `read`, `write`, `open`, and `close` — work directly with **file
descriptors** rather than `FILE *` pointers. You will encounter them in systems
programming, and understanding them helps you see what `stdio` is actually
doing under the hood.

\index{file descriptor}
## File Descriptors

A file descriptor is a small non-negative integer that the operating system
uses to identify an open file (or pipe, socket, device, etc.). When your
program starts, three file descriptors are already open:

| File Descriptor | POSIX Name | Purpose |
|:---|:---|:---|
| 0 | `STDIN_FILENO` | Standard input |
| 1 | `STDOUT_FILENO` | Standard output |
| 2 | `STDERR_FILENO` | Standard error |

\index{unistd.h}
These constants are defined in `<unistd.h>`. They correspond to `stdin`,
`stdout`, and `stderr` from `<stdio.h>`, but at a lower level.

\index{read}
\index{write}
## `read` and `write`

```c
ssize_t read(int fd, void *buf, size_t count);
ssize_t write(int fd, const void *buf, size_t count);
```

The `read` and `write` system calls transfer raw bytes between a file
descriptor and a buffer:

```c
#include <unistd.h>

// write(fd, buffer, count) — returns bytes written
write(1, "Blue Monday\n", 12);   // write 12 bytes to stdout

// read(fd, buffer, count) — returns bytes read
char buf[100];
ssize_t n = read(0, buf, sizeof(buf));  // read from stdin
write(1, buf, n);                        // echo it back
```

`read` returns the number of bytes actually read (which may be less than
requested), 0 at end of file, or -1 on error. `write` returns the number of
bytes actually written, or -1 on error.

Unlike `printf` and `scanf`, these functions perform no formatting — they
transfer raw bytes. There are no format specifiers, no newline handling, no
buffering.

\index{open}
\index{close}
## `open` and `close`

```c
int open(const char *path, int flags, ... /* mode_t mode */);
int close(int fd);
```

\index{fcntl.h}
To open a file at the system call level, use `open` from `<fcntl.h>`:

```c
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int fd = open("data.txt", O_RDONLY);
if (fd == -1) {
    write(2, "Cannot open file\n", 17);
    return 1;
}

char buf[256];
ssize_t n = read(fd, buf, sizeof(buf));
write(1, buf, n);

close(fd);
```

The second argument to `open` is a set of flags combined with bitwise OR:

| Flag | Purpose |
|:---|:---|
| `O_RDONLY` | Open for reading only |
| `O_WRONLY` | Open for writing only |
| `O_RDWR` | Open for reading and writing |
| `O_CREAT` | Create the file if it does not exist |
| `O_TRUNC` | Truncate the file to zero length |
| `O_APPEND` | Append to the file |

To **create a new file** (or truncate an existing one), combine flags:

```c
int fd = open("output.txt", O_WRONLY | O_CREAT | O_TRUNC, 0644);
```

The third argument (`0644`) is the **file permissions** — only used with
`O_CREAT`. The value `0644` means the owner can read and write, and everyone
else can only read.

There is also `creat`, which is equivalent to `open` with
`O_WRONLY | O_CREAT | O_TRUNC`:

```c
int creat(const char *path, mode_t mode);
```

```c
int fd = creat("output.txt", 0644);
// same as: open("output.txt", O_WRONLY | O_CREAT | O_TRUNC, 0644)
```

::: {.tip}
**Wut:** Yes, it is `creat` with no `e`. Ken Thompson was once asked what he
would do differently if he were redesigning Unix. His answer: "I'd spell creat
with an e."
:::

\index{lseek}
## Seeking: `lseek`

```c
off_t lseek(int fd, off_t offset, int whence);
```

`lseek` repositions the file offset for an open file descriptor:

```c
#include <unistd.h>

lseek(fd, 0, SEEK_SET);     // go to beginning
lseek(fd, 0, SEEK_END);     // go to end
lseek(fd, 100, SEEK_SET);   // go to byte 100

off_t pos = lseek(fd, 0, SEEK_CUR);  // get current position (no move)
```

\index{SEEK\_SET}
\index{SEEK\_CUR}
\index{SEEK\_END}
The three `SEEK_` constants control where the offset is relative to:

| Constant | Meaning |
|:---|:---|
| `SEEK_SET` | Relative to the beginning of the file |
| `SEEK_CUR` | Relative to the current position |
| `SEEK_END` | Relative to the end of the file |

`lseek` returns the new offset from the beginning of the file, or -1 on error.

::: {.tip}
**Tip:** In `<stdio.h>`, the equivalent functions are `fseek` and `ftell`. The
low-level `lseek` combines both: calling `lseek(fd, 0, SEEK_CUR)` returns the
current position without moving, just like `ftell`.
:::

\index{pread}
\index{pwrite}
## `pread` and `pwrite`

```c
ssize_t pread(int fd, void *buf, size_t count, off_t offset);
ssize_t pwrite(int fd, const void *buf, size_t count, off_t offset);
```

`pread` and `pwrite` are like `read` and `write` but take an explicit offset
instead of using (or modifying) the file's current position:

```c
// Read 100 bytes starting at offset 200, without changing the file position
ssize_t n = pread(fd, buf, 100, 200);

// Write 50 bytes at offset 0, without changing the file position
pwrite(fd, data, 50, 0);
```

These are useful in multi-threaded programs where multiple threads share a file
descriptor — since they do not modify the file position, there is no race
condition.

## Try It: Low-Level I/O Starter

```c
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    // write to stdout using file descriptor 1
    const char *msg = "Low-level I/O starter\n";
    write(STDOUT_FILENO, msg, strlen(msg));

    // open, write, close
    int fd = open("/tmp/tryit_lowio.txt", O_WRONLY | O_CREAT | O_TRUNC, 0644);
    if (fd == -1) {
        write(STDERR_FILENO, "open failed\n", 12);
        return 1;
    }

    const char *lines[] = {"Twist of Cain\n", "Year: 1987\n"};
    for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++)
        write(fd, lines[i], strlen(lines[i]));
    close(fd);

    // open, read, print
    fd = open("/tmp/tryit_lowio.txt", O_RDONLY);
    char buf[256];
    ssize_t n = read(fd, buf, sizeof(buf));
    write(STDOUT_FILENO, buf, n);

    // lseek: go back to start and read again
    lseek(fd, 0, SEEK_SET);
    n = read(fd, buf, sizeof(buf));
    printf("Read %zd bytes on second pass\n", n);

    close(fd);
    return 0;
}
```

## Key Points

- File descriptors are small integers: 0 is stdin, 1 is stdout, 2 is stderr.
- `read` and `write` transfer raw bytes — no formatting, no buffering.
- `open` returns a file descriptor; `fopen` returns a `FILE *`. They are
  different levels of abstraction.
- Use `O_CREAT` with `open` to create files. Always provide a permissions
  argument when using `O_CREAT`.
- `lseek` repositions the read/write offset. Use `SEEK_SET`, `SEEK_CUR`, or
  `SEEK_END`.
- `pread` and `pwrite` read/write at a specific offset without changing the
  file position.

## Exercises

1. **Think about it:** Why would you use low-level `read`/`write` instead of
   `fprintf`/`fscanf`? When would `stdio` be the better choice?

2. **What does this print?**

    ```c
    write(1, "ABC", 3);
    write(1, "DEF\n", 4);
    ```

3. **Calculation:** If `read(fd, buf, 1024)` returns 512, what does that tell
   you? Does it mean there was an error?

4. **Where is the bug?**

    ```c
    int fd = open("newfile.txt", O_WRONLY | O_CREAT);
    write(fd, "Hello\n", 6);
    close(fd);
    ```

5. **Think about it:** Explain the difference between
   `lseek(fd, 0, SEEK_END)` and `lseek(fd, -1, SEEK_END)`. What does each
   return?

6. **Write a program** that uses low-level I/O (`open`, `read`, `write`,
   `close`) to copy the contents of one file to another. The source and
   destination filenames should be taken from `argv`.

# 8. Odds and Ends

This chapter covers a few remaining topics that do not fit neatly into the
previous chapters but are important for writing real C programs and for working
with C code from C++.

\index{exit}
## `exit` vs `return`

```c
void exit(int status);
```

You already know that `return` in `main` ends the program. The `exit` function
from `<stdlib.h>` does the same thing, but it can be called from *any*
function — not just `main`:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void check_file(const char *path) {
    FILE *f = fopen(path, "r");
    if (f == NULL) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Fatal: cannot open %s\n", path);
        exit(1);   // end the program immediately
    }
    // ... work with the file ...
    fclose(f);
}
```

`exit` is useful when an error deep inside a call chain is unrecoverable and
there is no reasonable way to propagate the error back through multiple layers
of callers. In C++, you would throw an exception; in C, `exit` is sometimes the
pragmatic choice.

\index{atexit}
`exit` also flushes all open `stdio` streams and calls any functions registered
with `atexit` before terminating the program.

```c
int atexit(void (*func)(void));
```

::: {.tip}
**Tip:** Use `exit` sparingly. It is a blunt instrument — it ends the entire
program immediately, skipping any cleanup code in calling functions. If you can
reasonably propagate an error code back to `main` and let `main` return, prefer
that approach. Reserve `exit` for truly fatal errors.
:::

\index{extern ""C""}
## `extern "C"` — Calling C from C++

If you are writing C++ code that needs to call functions from a C library, you
need `extern "C"`. The reason: C++ **mangles** function names to support
overloading (so `void foo(int)` and `void foo(double)` have different symbol
names), but C does not. Without `extern "C"`, the C++ linker looks for the
mangled name and cannot find the C function.

```cpp
// In your C++ code:
extern "C" {
    #include "my_c_library.h"   // treat these declarations as C
}
```

Or for a single function:

```cpp
extern "C" void c_function(int x);
```

Many C headers protect themselves with this pattern so they work from both C
and C++:

```c
#ifdef __cplusplus
extern "C" {
#endif

void some_function(int x);
int another_function(const char *s);

#ifdef __cplusplus
}
#endif
```

The `__cplusplus` macro is only defined when compiling with a C++ compiler, so
the `extern "C"` wrapper only appears in C++ compilation.

::: {.tip}
**Tip:** The reason C++ mangles names is to support **function overloading** —
having multiple functions with the same name but different parameter types. C
has no function overloading. Every function name must be unique. If you need
two functions that do the same thing for different types, you give them
different names — for example, `abs` for `int`, `fabs` for `double`, and
`labs` for `long`. The upside is that when you see a function call in C, you
know exactly which function will be invoked — there is only one version.
:::

\index{pointer!ownership}
## Pointer Ownership

In C++, smart pointers make ownership clear: a `std::unique_ptr` owns the
memory, and when it goes out of scope, the memory is freed. In C, there are no
smart pointers. When a function returns a pointer, you must ask: **who owns
this memory?**

There are three common patterns:

**1. The caller owns it (you must free).** The function allocates memory and
hands ownership to you:

```c
char *copy = strdup("Everybody Wants to Rule the World");
// You own this memory. You must free it.
free(copy);
```

**2. The library owns it (do not free).** The function returns a pointer to
memory it manages internally:

```c
struct hostent *h = gethostbyname("example.com");
// The library owns this. Do NOT free it.
```

**3. You own it (you passed it in).** You allocated the memory and passed a
pointer to the function. The function used it but did not take ownership:

```c
char buf[100];
fgets(buf, sizeof(buf), stdin);
// You still own buf. Nothing to free (it's on the stack).
```

::: {.tip}
\index{dangling pointer}
\index{use-after-free}
\index{double free}
**Trap:** Always read the documentation of a C function that returns a pointer.
Look for words like "the caller must free the returned pointer" or "the
returned pointer points to a static buffer." If the documentation does not say,
look at the source code. Getting ownership wrong leads to either memory leaks
(never freeing) or double-free bugs (freeing what you do not own).
:::

## Error Handling Without Exceptions

In C++, you can `throw` an exception and let a `catch` block handle it several
call levels up. C has no exceptions. Error handling is done through return
codes, and cleanup is your responsibility.

The simplest pattern is to check return values and bail out:

```c
void perror(const char *s);
```

```c
FILE *f = fopen("La Isla Bonita.txt", "r");
if (!f) {
    perror("fopen");
    return -1;
}
```

\index{goto}
But what happens when a function acquires multiple resources? You need to
release them in the correct order when something goes wrong. The idiomatic
C pattern uses `goto` to jump to cleanup labels:

```c
int process(const char *path) {
    int status = -1;

    FILE *f = fopen(path, "r");
    if (!f) return -1;

    char *buf = malloc(1024);
    if (!buf) goto close_file;

    char *line = malloc(256);
    if (!line) goto free_buf;

    /* do work with f, buf, and line ... */
    status = 0;

    free(line);
free_buf:
    free(buf);
close_file:
    fclose(f);
    return status;
}
```

Each resource acquired gets a corresponding cleanup label below it. If any
allocation fails, control jumps to the label that releases everything acquired
so far, in reverse order. This pattern is used extensively in real C code
including the Linux kernel.

::: {.tip}
**Wut:** C++ programmers are taught "never use `goto`." In C, `goto` for
cleanup is an accepted and widely used idiom. It is the closest thing C has
to RAII — a structured way to ensure resources are always released.
:::

\index{errno}
\index{perror}
The other common strategy is to return an error code (often `-1` or `NULL`)
and let the caller decide what to do. Many C library functions set the global
variable `errno` to indicate what went wrong, and you can use `perror` or
`strerror(errno)` to get a human-readable message:

```c
char *strerror(int errnum);
```

```c
FILE *f = fopen("No Existe.txt", "r");
if (!f) {
    perror("fopen");    // prints: fopen: No such file or directory
}
```

\index{function pointer}
\index{qsort}
## Function Pointers and `qsort`

In C++, you pass behavior to functions using lambdas, `std::function`, or
template parameters. C has none of those — instead, you use **function
pointers**. A function pointer holds the address of a function, and you can
call it just like a regular function.

Here is a simple example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int add(int a, int b) { return a + b; }
int mul(int a, int b) { return a * b; }

int main(void) {
    int (*op)(int, int);   // declare a function pointer

    op = add;
    printf("%d\n", op(3, 4));   // 7

    op = mul;
    printf("%d\n", op(3, 4));   // 12
    return 0;
}
```

The declaration `int (*op)(int, int)` reads: `op` is a pointer to a function
that takes two `int` parameters and returns an `int`. The parentheses around
`*op` are required — without them, `int *op(int, int)` would declare a
function that returns an `int *`.

::: {.tip}
**Tip:** Function pointer declarations are notoriously hard to read. A
`typedef` makes them much clearer:

```c
typedef int (*binop_fn)(int, int);
binop_fn op = add;
printf("%d\n", op(3, 4));
```
:::

The most common place you will encounter function pointers is the standard
library function `qsort` from `<stdlib.h>`. In C++, you would use
`std::sort` with a lambda or comparator. In C, `qsort` takes a comparison
function pointer:

```c
void qsort(void *base, size_t nel, size_t width,
           int (*compar)(const void *, const void *));
```

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

int compare_ints(const void *a, const void *b) {
    int ia = *(const int *)a;
    int ib = *(const int *)b;
    return (ia > ib) - (ia < ib);
}

int main(void) {
    int years[] = {1989, 1982, 1985, 1980, 1987};
    int n = sizeof(years) / sizeof(years[0]);

    qsort(years, n, sizeof(int), compare_ints);

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("%d ", years[i]);
    }
    printf("\n");
    // Output: 1980 1982 1985 1987 1989
    return 0;
}
```

`qsort` takes four arguments: the array, the number of elements, the size of
each element, and a pointer to a comparison function. The comparison function
receives `const void *` pointers — you must cast them to the correct type
inside the function. It returns a negative value if the first argument is less
than the second, zero if equal, and a positive value if greater.

You can sort anything with `qsort` by writing different comparison functions.
Here is one that sorts strings:

```c
int compare_strings(const void *a, const void *b) {
    const char *sa = *(const char **)a;
    const char *sb = *(const char **)b;
    return strcmp(sa, sb);
}

int main(void) {
    const char *songs[] = {
        "Maniac", "Footloose", "Flashdance", "Fame"
    };
    int n = sizeof(songs) / sizeof(songs[0]);

    qsort(songs, n, sizeof(char *), compare_strings);

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("%s\n", songs[i]);
    }
    // Output:
    // Fame
    // Flashdance
    // Footloose
    // Maniac
    return 0;
}
```

Notice the double cast in `compare_strings`: `qsort` passes a pointer *to*
each array element, and each element is already a `char *`, so you receive a
`char **` disguised as `const void *`.

::: {.tip}
**Wut:** A common mistake is to write `return a - b` in integer comparison
functions. This can overflow when `a` and `b` have very different signs (e.g.,
`INT_MAX - (-1)` overflows). The pattern `(a > b) - (a < b)` is safe and
returns -1, 0, or 1.
:::

## Try It: Odds and Ends Starter

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

// A comparison function for qsort
// a normal numeric sort, but we want 1984 to always be first
// because we are big thriller fans!
int compare_ints(const void *a, const void *b) {
    int ia = *(const int *)a;
    int ib = *(const int *)b;
    // 1982 always appears first (Thriller came out in 1982)
    if (ia == 1982 && ib == 1982) return 0;

    qsort(years, n, sizeof(int), compare_ints);

    printf("Sorted: ");
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        printf("%d ", years[i]);

## Key Points

- `exit` terminates the program from any function. Use it for unrecoverable
  errors.
- `exit` flushes `stdio` streams and calls `atexit` handlers before
  terminating.
- `extern "C"` tells the C++ compiler not to mangle function names, so it can
  link to C libraries.
- C headers often use `#ifdef __cplusplus` to wrap declarations in
  `extern "C"` automatically.
- When you receive a pointer from a function, always determine who owns the
  memory: you, the function, or a library.
- C has no exceptions. Use return codes for errors and `goto` cleanup for
  releasing resources in the correct order.
- Function pointers let you pass behavior to functions. `qsort` is the most
  common example — it takes a comparison function pointer to sort any type.

## Exercises

1. **Think about it:** In C++ you would use exceptions for error handling. In C
   there are no exceptions. What strategies can you use to handle errors in
   deeply nested function calls? When is `exit` appropriate and when is it not?

2. **What happens here?**

    ```c
    #include <stdlib.h>
    #include <stdio.h>

    void cleanup(void) {
        printf("Adios!\n");
    }

    int main(void) {
        atexit(cleanup);
        printf("Starting...\n");
        exit(0);
    }
    ```

3. **Where is the bug?**

    ```c
    char *get_greeting(void) {
        char buf[50];
        sprintf(buf, "Hola, mundo");
        return buf;
    }
    ```

4. **Think about it:** You call a function `char *get_name(int id)` from a
   library. How would you determine whether you need to `free` the returned
   pointer?

5. **Where is the bug?** (Hint: ownership)

    ```c
    char *name = strdup("Walking on Sunshine");
    char *alias = name;
    free(name);
    printf("%s\n", alias);
    ```

6. **Calculation:** Given `int nums[] = {5, 10, 15, 20};`, what is the value of
   `sizeof(nums) / sizeof(nums[0])`?

7. **What does this print?**

    ```c
    int compare_desc(const void *a, const void *b) {
        int ia = *(const int *)a;
        int ib = *(const int *)b;
        return (ib > ia) - (ib < ia);
    }

    int main(void) {
        int vals[] = {3, 1, 4, 1, 5};
        qsort(vals, 5, sizeof(int), compare_desc);
        printf("%d %d %d %d %d\n", vals[0], vals[1], vals[2], vals[3], vals[4]);
        return 0;
    }
    ```

8. **Write a program** that uses `qsort` to sort an array of strings in
   reverse alphabetical order. Write a custom comparison function that calls
   `strcmp` with the arguments swapped.

9. **Write a program** in C++ that uses `extern "C"` to call the C function
   `strlen` from `<string.h>`, passes it a string, and prints the result.
   Compile it with `c++` to verify it works.

# Conclusion

You have covered a lot of ground — from `printf` format specifiers to file
descriptors to pointer ownership. Here are the key takeaways:

- **C and C++ are different languages.** Modern C++ has evolved far from C.
  Knowing one does not mean you automatically know the other.
- **`printf` and `scanf` replace `iostream`.** Format specifiers must match
  argument types. `scanf` needs `&` for scalar variables.
- **Pointers hold memory addresses.** Use `&` to get an address, `*` to follow
  one, and `->` to access struct fields through a pointer. Arrays decay to
  pointers, and pointer arithmetic moves in units of the pointed-to type.
- **All function arguments are pass by value.** To modify a caller's variable,
  pass a pointer to it.
- **Know where your memory lives.** Global variables last the whole program,
  local variables live on the stack, and dynamic memory from `malloc` lives on
  the heap until you `free` it.
- **Strings in C are `char` arrays** terminated by `'\0'`. You must manage
  buffer sizes manually and use functions like `strlen`, `strcpy`, `strcmp`, and
  `strcat` instead of `std::string` methods.
- **`stdio` provides buffered I/O** through `FILE *` pointers. Low-level I/O
  uses file descriptors and system calls like `read`, `write`, and `open`.
- **C has no exceptions.** Use return codes for errors and `goto` cleanup to
  release resources in reverse order.
- **Function pointers replace lambdas.** `qsort` is the classic example —
  pass a comparison function to sort any type.
- **`exit` terminates from anywhere.** Use it for fatal errors. `extern "C"`
  bridges C and C++. Always know who owns a pointer.

Es un mundo nuevo, but you have the C++ foundation to build on. The syntax will
feel familiar even when the idioms are different. Write small programs, compile
them with `cc`, and get comfortable with the compiler's warnings — they are
your best amigo.

Buena suerte — you have got this.

# Appendix A: Macros

In C++, you have `constexpr` for compile-time constants, templates for generic
code, and `inline` functions to avoid call overhead. C has none of those.
Instead, C leans heavily on the **preprocessor** — the `#define` macro system
that rewrites your source code *before* the compiler sees it.

Macros are pure textual substitution. The preprocessor does not know about
types, scope, or expressions — it just replaces text. This makes macros
powerful and flexible, but also a source of subtle bugs if you are not careful.

\index{macro!object-like}
\index{\#define}
## Object-Like Macros

The simplest macros define named constants:

```c
#define MAX_BUF   1024
#define PI        3.14159265
#define GREETING  "Hola, amigo"
```

Everywhere the preprocessor sees `MAX_BUF`, it replaces it with `1024`. No
semicolons — a common mistake is writing `#define MAX_BUF 1024;`, which would
paste `1024;` everywhere, breaking expressions like `malloc(MAX_BUF * sizeof(int))`.

::: {.tip}
**Trap:** Do not put a semicolon at the end of a `#define`. The semicolon
becomes part of the replacement text and will cause surprising errors.
:::

\index{conditional compilation}
### Conditional Compilation

Macros also control which code the compiler sees:

```c
#define DEBUG

#ifdef DEBUG
    printf("x = %d\n", x);
#endif
```

`#ifdef` checks whether a macro is defined (regardless of its value). Its
complement `#ifndef` checks that a macro is *not* defined. You can also use
`#if`, `#elif`, and `#else` for more complex conditions:

```c
#if VERBOSE_LEVEL >= 2
    printf("Detailed trace...\n");
#elif VERBOSE_LEVEL == 1
    printf("Basic trace...\n");
#else
    /* no tracing */
#endif
```

\index{include guard}
### Include Guards

The most common use of `#ifndef` is protecting header files from being included
more than once:

```c
/* myheader.h */
#ifndef MYHEADER_H
#define MYHEADER_H

struct point {
    int x, y;
};

void draw_point(struct point p);

#endif /* MYHEADER_H */
```

The first time `myheader.h` is included, `MYHEADER_H` is not defined, so the
contents are processed and `MYHEADER_H` gets defined. Any subsequent include
finds `MYHEADER_H` already defined and skips the entire file.

::: {.tip}
**Tip:** Many compilers support `#pragma once` as a non-standard alternative to
include guards. It is simpler to write but not portable to all compilers. When
in doubt, use the `#ifndef` guard — it works everywhere.
:::

\index{macro!function-like}
## Function-Like Macros

Macros can take parameters, making them look like functions:

```c
#define SQUARE(x)   ((x) * (x))
#define MAX(a, b)   ((a) > (b) ? (a) : (b))
#define ABS(x)      ((x) < 0 ? -(x) : (x))
```

But they are *not* functions — they are text substitution with parameter
placeholders. This distinction matters.

### The Parenthesization Rules

Always parenthesize every parameter use *and* the entire macro body:

```c
/* Wrong: */
#define SQUARE(x) x * x

/* SQUARE(1 + 2) expands to: 1 + 2 * 1 + 2 = 5 (not 9!) */

/* Right: */
#define SQUARE(x) ((x) * (x))

/* SQUARE(1 + 2) expands to: ((1 + 2) * (1 + 2)) = 9 */
```

Without parentheses, operator precedence in the surrounding expression can
silently rearrange the computation.

### The Double-Evaluation Trap

Since macros substitute text, each parameter reference evaluates the argument
again:

```c
#define SQUARE(x) ((x) * (x))

int i = 3;
int result = SQUARE(i++);
/* Expands to: ((i++) * (i++)) — i is incremented TWICE */
/* Undefined behavior: two unsequenced modifications of i */
```

A real function evaluates its argument once. A macro evaluates it once per
appearance in the replacement text. This is the most important difference
between macros and functions.

::: {.tip}
**Trap:** Never pass expressions with side effects (like `i++`, `f()`, or
assignment) to function-like macros. The expression will be evaluated multiple
times, producing unexpected results or undefined behavior.
:::

### Multi-Statement Macros: `do { ... } while (0)`

If a macro needs to execute multiple statements, wrap them in
`do { ... } while (0)`:

```c
#define SWAP(a, b) do { \
    int tmp = (a);      \
    (a) = (b);          \
    (b) = tmp;          \
} while (0)
```

Why not just use braces? Consider:

```c
if (x > y)
    SWAP(x, y);
else
    printf("Already sorted\n");
```

If `SWAP` expanded to a bare `{ ... }`, the semicolon after `SWAP(x, y)` would
terminate the `if` statement, and the `else` would become a syntax error. The
`do { ... } while (0)` idiom creates a single statement that works correctly
with semicolons and control flow.

::: {.tip}
**Tip:** The `do { ... } while (0)` pattern is everywhere in C codebases. It
looks odd at first, but it is the standard way to make multi-statement macros
behave like ordinary statements.
:::

\index{stringification}
\index{token pasting}
## Stringification and Token Pasting

The preprocessor has two special operators for macro arguments.

### Stringification: `#`

The `#` operator turns a macro argument into a string literal:

```c
#define PRINT_VAR(x) printf(#x " = %d\n", x)

int score = 42;
PRINT_VAR(score);
/* Expands to: printf("score" " = %d\n", score); */
/* Adjacent string literals are concatenated: "score = %d\n" */
/* Output: score = 42 */
```

This is useful for debug macros where you want to print both the variable name
and its value.

### Token Pasting: `##`

The `##` operator joins two tokens into one:

```c
#define DECLARE_PAIR(type) \
    type type##_first;     \
    type type##_second;

DECLARE_PAIR(int)
/* Expands to:
   int int_first;
   int int_second;
*/
```

Token pasting is commonly used to generate families of related variables or
functions from a single macro.

\index{variadic macro}
\index{\_\_VA\_ARGS\_\_}
## Variadic Macros

Macros can accept a variable number of arguments using `...` and `__VA_ARGS__`:

```c
#define LOG(fmt, ...) fprintf(stderr, "[LOG] " fmt "\n", __VA_ARGS__)

LOG("score is %d", 42);
/* Expands to: fprintf(stderr, "[LOG] " "score is %d" "\n", 42); */
```

This is commonly used to wrap `printf`-style functions with extra decoration
like timestamps or log levels.

::: {.tip}
**Tip:** When `__VA_ARGS__` is empty, the trailing comma before it can cause a
compilation error. GNU C provides `##__VA_ARGS__` which swallows the comma when
the argument list is empty:

```c
#define LOG(fmt, ...) fprintf(stderr, "[LOG] " fmt "\n", ##__VA_ARGS__)
LOG("started");  /* No extra args — comma is removed */
```

This is a GCC/Clang extension. C23 standardizes this behavior with
`__VA_OPT__`.
:::

## Multi-Level Expansion

Macros can expand to other macros, and the preprocessor **rescans** the result
to expand again. But the `#` and `##` operators are special — they operate on
the raw argument text *before* any expansion happens.

```c
#define MAX_BUF 1024
#define STRINGIFY(x)  #x
#define XSTRINGIFY(x) STRINGIFY(x)

printf("%s\n", STRINGIFY(MAX_BUF));
/* # operates before expansion: prints "MAX_BUF" */

printf("%s\n", XSTRINGIFY(MAX_BUF));
/* First pass: XSTRINGIFY(MAX_BUF) → STRINGIFY(1024) */
/* Rescan:     STRINGIFY(1024) → "1024" */
/* Prints "1024" */
```

`STRINGIFY(MAX_BUF)` gives `"MAX_BUF"` because `#` stringifies its argument
before expansion. `XSTRINGIFY(MAX_BUF)` first expands `MAX_BUF` to `1024`
(since the outer macro does not use `#` directly), then passes `1024` to
`STRINGIFY`, producing `"1024"`.

This two-level indirect pattern is used whenever you need the *expanded* value
of a macro as a string.

::: {.tip}
**Tip:** Whenever you need a macro's expanded value as a string, use the
two-level indirect pattern. It comes up often when embedding version numbers
or configuration values in strings.
:::

\index{X-macro}
## X-Macros

X-macros are a technique for defining a list of items once and expanding it in
multiple ways. The idea: define the list as a macro that calls an unspecified
"action" macro on each item, then define that action differently for each use.

Here is a concrete example that generates both an enum and a string table from
a single list of log levels:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

/* Define the list once */
#define LOG_LEVELS(X) \
    X(LOG_DEBUG)      \
    X(LOG_INFO)       \
    X(LOG_WARN)       \
    X(LOG_ERROR)      \
    X(LOG_FATAL)

/* Generate the enum */
#define AS_ENUM(name) name,
enum log_level { LOG_LEVELS(AS_ENUM) LOG_COUNT };

/* Generate the string table */
#define AS_STRING(name) #name,
const char *log_level_names[] = { LOG_LEVELS(AS_STRING) };

int main(void) {
    for (int i = 0; i < LOG_COUNT; i++) {
        printf("%d = %s\n", i, log_level_names[i]);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Output:

```
0 = LOG_DEBUG
1 = LOG_INFO
2 = LOG_WARN
3 = LOG_ERROR
4 = LOG_FATAL
```

Add a new log level? Add one line to `LOG_LEVELS` and the enum and string
table stay in sync automatically. Without X-macros, you would need to update
both the enum and the string array separately — and hope you never forget one.

::: {.tip}
**Tip:** X-macros are one of the preprocessor's most powerful patterns. You
will see them in real codebases for error codes, command tables, and state
machines. The key advantage: a single source of truth for a list of items.

## Try It: Macro Starter

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// Object-like macros
#define MAX_TRACKS  10
#define LABEL       "Sire Records"

// Function-like macro with proper parenthesization
#define SQUARE(x)   ((x) * (x))
#define MAX(a, b)   ((a) > (b) ? (a) : (b))

// Stringification: print variable name and value
#define PRINT_INT(var) printf(#var " = %d\n", var)

// Multi-statement macro using do { ... } while (0)
#define SWAP(a, b) do { \
    int tmp = (a);      \
    (a) = (b);          \
    (b) = tmp;          \
} while (0)

// Variadic macro
#define LOG(fmt, ...) fprintf(stderr, "[LOG] " fmt "\n", ##__VA_ARGS__)

int main(void) {
    // Object-like
    printf("Label: %s, Max tracks: %d\n", LABEL, MAX_TRACKS);

    // Function-like
    printf("SQUARE(5) = %d\n", SQUARE(5));
    printf("SQUARE(1+2) = %d\n", SQUARE(1 + 2));
    printf("MAX(3, 7) = %d\n", MAX(3, 7));

    // Stringification
    int year = 1984;
    PRINT_INT(year);

    // SWAP
    int a = 10, b = 20;
    printf("Before swap: a=%d, b=%d\n", a, b);
    SWAP(a, b);
    printf("After swap:  a=%d, b=%d\n", a, b);

    // Conditional compilation
#ifdef DEBUG
    printf("Debug mode is on\n");
#else
    printf("Debug mode is off\n");
#endif

    // Variadic macro
    LOG("started");
    LOG("year is %d", 1985);

    return 0;
}
```

## Key Points

- Macros are **textual substitution** performed before compilation. They are
  not functions and do not respect scope or type rules.
- Object-like macros define constants and feature flags. Never end a `#define`
  with a semicolon.
- Function-like macros must have every parameter use and the entire body
  parenthesized to avoid precedence bugs.
- Macro arguments are evaluated each time they appear — do not pass expressions
  with side effects.
- Use `do { ... } while (0)` for multi-statement macros so they work correctly
  with `if`/`else` and semicolons.
- The `#` operator stringifies a macro argument; `##` pastes tokens together.
- `#` and `##` prevent argument expansion. Use the two-level indirect pattern
  (e.g., `XSTRINGIFY`/`STRINGIFY`) when you need the expanded value.
- `__VA_ARGS__` enables variadic macros for wrapping `printf`-style functions.
- X-macros define a list once and expand it multiple ways, keeping enums and
  string tables in sync.

## Exercises

1. **Think about it:** C++ uses `constexpr` and `inline` functions to replace
   many uses of macros. What specific problems do macros have that these C++
   features solve? Why does C still rely on macros despite these problems?

2. **What does this produce?**

    ```c
    #define DOUBLE(x) ((x) + (x))

    int i = 5;
    printf("%d\n", DOUBLE(i++));
    ```

3. **Calculation:** Given the macro `#define BUFSIZE 256`, how many bytes does
   `char buf[BUFSIZE + 1]` allocate? Why is the `+ 1` a common pattern?

4. **Where is the bug?**

    ```c
    #define MUL(a, b)  a * b

    int result = MUL(2 + 3, 4 + 5);
    printf("%d\n", result);
    ```

5. **What does this produce?**

    ```c
    #define STRINGIFY(x)  #x
    #define XSTRINGIFY(x) STRINGIFY(x)
    #define VERSION 3

    printf("[%s] [%s]\n", STRINGIFY(VERSION), XSTRINGIFY(VERSION));
    ```

6. **Where is the bug?**

    ```c
    #define LOG_IF(cond, msg) \
        if (cond) \
            printf("[WARN] %s\n", msg);

    if (x > 100)
        LOG_IF(x > 200, "very high");
    else
        printf("normal\n");
    ```

7. **Write a program** that defines an X-macro list of at least four colors,
   then uses it to generate both an `enum` and a function that returns the
   string name for a given enum value. Print each color's enum value and name.
